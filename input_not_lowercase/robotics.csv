1,What is the right approach to write the spin controller for a soccer robot?,"Imagine programming a 3 wheel soccer robot. What type of controller would you use for spinning it? P? PID?
The goal for this controller is that it should make the robot stand in a defined angle ( 0 degree ) and turn back if rotated by hand or other robot. 
I use stepper motors for my robot and not servos so I need to implement this in my software!
I have written a sample P type controller already and the movement is fairly good. But I would like to make it better if possible. The code is as follows:

correction is a range , in which robot has no movement. 
degree is a number between -127 and 128 which is returned from the compass.
motorSpeed is a number between 0 and 255 which is applied to the PWM.

2,How can I modify a low cost hobby servo to run 'freely'?,"I've got some hobby servos (Power HD 1501MGs) and I'd like to be able to control them (via an Arduino) so they will either go to the angle I set, or put them in a 'free running' mode, where the load will take them wherever it goes.
Is this even possible, or am I just going to end up stripping the gears?
My first thought is to simply kill the power to the servo, but the force required to move them in that state is more than I'd like.
If it is possible, am I looking at a hardware change, or could I do it in software?

5,Nearest-neighbor data structure for non-Euclidean configuration space,"I'm trying to implement a nearest-neighbor structure for use in an RRT motion planner. In order to do better than a linear brute-force nearest-neighbor search, I'd like to implement something like a kd-tree. However, it seems like the classical implementation of the kd-tree assumes that each dimension of the space can be split into ""left"" and ""right"". This notion doesn't seem to apply to non-Euclidean spaces like SO(2), for instance.
I'm working with a serial manipulator arm with fully rotational links, meaning that each dimension of the robot's configuration space is SO(2), and therefore non-Euclidean. Can the kd-tree algorithm be modified to handle these kinds of subspaces? If not, is there another nearest-neighbor structure that can handle these non-Euclidean subspaces while still being easy to update and query? I also took a look at FLANN, but it wasn't clear to me from their documentation whether they can handle non-Euclidean subspaces.

25,How to choose the right propeller/motor combination for a quadcopter?,"There are many sites which explain briefly this problem and even propose combinations. I however would like a much more detailed explanation. What is going to give my quad the most agility? Do I need bigger motors/props in a heavy quad to achieve the same level of agility than in a lighter quad?
EDIT:
Here is what I have understood on the subject:

A quadcopter doesn't need high revving motors as there are 4 propellers providing thrust and high revving motors require more battery power.
Larger propellers give more thrust per revolution from the motor.

The question is focused more on the general characteristics of various combinations but some specific questions do spring to mind: 

For a given combination what would be the effect of upgrading propeller size in comparison to installing higher revving motors?
What changes would need to be made to lift a heavier quad?

Considering this is an underwater vehicle, weight and size are also a concern.

Would using a much better antenna help, especially for low signal areas? I'm thinking yes to this, but if so how would I construct such an antenna and know that it's an improvement? Are there any good guides on how to do this? I could use a ready made antenna if they're not too expensive.
Would using multiple separate receivers in tandem help, or would they likely all be off by a similar amount, or would I not be able to extract a meaningful average with this approach?

55,Adding external heat sinking to a Dynamixel RX-24F servo?,"Hobby servos are generally not sufficient for real robotics for a number of reasons: Quality, precision, range of motion, torque, etc.
Meanwhile, industrial servos, such as ABB, Emerson, GE, etc, are generally both heavy and expensive, and not suitable for small-humanoid scale actuation. Similarly, building your own servo from motors, gearboxes, and encoders, is akin to trying to design your own CPU just to control a motor -- too much detail getting in the way of real work.
There exists an in-between level of servos -- reasonably priced, reasonable performance, and reasonably controllable -- in the form of the competing brands of Dynamixel and HerculeX servos.
The smallest offerings in those lines generally are not strong enough for real-world interaction, but the next step up hold a lot of promise. For the Robotis Dynamixel line, this is the RX-24F servo (priced between the cheap AX-12F and the next step up the MX-28R.) Asking around, it seems that the specs and interface on that servo is great, but that it shuts down from thermal overload if you actually try to run it at rated load -- something that I'd expect from a hobby servo, but not a robotics servo.
Now, stepping up to the MX-28R doubles the price. Thus, if the RX-24F heat flaw could be fixed, it would be positioned at a nice price/performance point.
Does anyone have experience in providing additional cooling for this servo? Anything from thermal-gluing heat sinks to the case, to drilling holes and running cooling fluid tubing to any hot parts on the interior would be reasonable approaches. However, before I spend significant time and effort investigating this, I'd like a second opinion -- is it possible, does anyone have experience doing this, is it worth it?

It was kept stable with a PID controller, which was designed using a root locus algorithm to keep it stable and modulate the performance parameters (such as percent overshoot, settling time, etc.). I wanted to attempt to keep it stable while simultaneously propelling it forward, but I couldn't figure out how to go about designing a linear controller that could do that.

85,Shape Memory Alloy wire for robot gripper arm actuation: How to vary grip pressure?,"For a robotic gripper arm we are designing for factory floor use on very small components, we propose to use electrically activated Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wire harnesses for actuation. 
The device being designed is akin to Pick & Place machines used for circuit assembly, but moves over an aircraft-hanger sized work surface on wheels. It manipulates irregular shaped and porous objects between 0.5 cu.cm and 8 cu.cm each - hence the traditional vacuum P&P mechanism does not appeal. Also, individual objects in the assembly line have varying hardness and weights.
Our design constraints are: 

Ensuring minimal to zero vibration and sound 
Using minimal volume within the mechanism (batteries are at the wheelbase, providing stability, so their weight is not a concern)
Fine variation of gripper pressure

We believe SMA meets the first two constraints well, but need some guidance on achieving constraint 3, i.e. different levels of pressure of the gripper controlled electronically.
My questions:

Can PWM of a current above the activation threshold (320 mA for 0.005 inch Flexinol HT) provide variable, repeatable actuation force? 
Would we need pressure sensors on each fingertip and a closed loop control for grip, or can the gripper be calibrated periodically and maintain repeatable force?

Some problems start to occur if the AVR starts to get overloaded. The circular queues will lose chunks of data. To solve this, I can reduce the load on the AVR (for example, by skipping some cycles in the timer). However, this is a manual process, where it is reduced if the AVR appears to have problems. This is partly because I do want relatively consistent timer periods.

There's no need to mention why real-time operations are important for a robot. My question is however, how much is it actually used in robotics?
Take this question for example. Only one answer mentions any platform with real-time capabilities, and it is far from the top too. ROS apparently, being a very popular platform which is not real-time.
In the real-time world however, RTAI1 seems to be the only workable free real-time platform of use. It is however, limited to Linux (no problem), badly documented and slowly developed.
So, how much is real-time behavior sought after among robotics developers? The question is, how much are developers inclined to write real-time applications when real-time behavior is actually needed? If not much, why?
For example, reflexive behavior based on tactile data, cannot go through ROS because it would lose its real-time property. But do people really come up with a real-time solution or use ROS anyway, ignoring the real-time property?

150,Preventing leaks in motor shafts for underwater bots,"Whenever building an aquatic bot, we always have to take care to prevent leakages, for obvious reasons. Now, holes for wires can be made watertight easily--but what about motors? We can easily seal the casing in place (and fill in any holes in the casing), but the part where the axle meets the casing is still left unprotected. 

Water leaking into the motor is still quite bad. I doubt there's any way to seal up this area properly, since any solid seal will not let the axle move, and any liquid seal (or something like grease) will rub off eventually.
I was thinking of putting a second casing around the motor, maybe with a custom rubber orifice for the shaft. Something like (forgive the bad drawing, not used to GIMP):

This would probably stop leakage, but would reduce the torque/rpm significantly via friction.

154,Fixed point arithmetic on microcontrollers,"Often we use microcontrollers to do things in our robots, but need to make some calculations in decimal. Using floating point variables is very slow, because a software floating point library is automatically included (unless you have a high-end microcontroller). Therefore, we generally use fixed point arithmetic.
Whenever I do this, I just use an integer, and remember where the decimal place is. However, it does take some care to ensure that everything is consistent, especially when calculations involve variables where the decimal point is in a different place.
I have implemented a fixed point atan2 function, but because I was trying to squeeze every last drop of limited precision (16 bits), I would often change the definition of where the decimal point is, and it would change as I tweaked it. In addition, I would have some constants, as a quasi look-up table, which themselves have an implied decimal point somewhere.
I want to know if there is a better way. Is there a library, or set of macros, that can simplify the use of fixed point variables, making multiplication and division between mixed variables easier, and allowing declaration of decimal numbers or constant expressions, but automatically converting to the desired fixed point representation at compile time?

We've temporarily used an Android phone (Galaxy S2) as a replacement IMU, and the results are so much better compared to the old IMUs. However, I don't like depending on a WiFi connection between IMU and the control computer (a laptop running ROS/Ubuntu), so we're looking to buy a new IMU.
What IMU should we choose? What criteria are important to consider for our application? Please share your experiences! :-)

Those using a screw-like mechanism are uniform, but slow.

209,How to determine quality of ICP matches?,"In SLAM frontends which use the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm for identifying the association between two matching point clouds, how can you determine if the algorithm is stuck in a local minimum and returns a wrong result? 
The problem is defined as matching two pointclouds which are both samples of some arbitrary surface structure, and the sampled areas have an overlap of 0-100% which is unknown. I know the Trimmed ICP variant works by iteratively trying to determine the overlap, but even this one can be stuck in a local minimum. 
A naive approach would be to look a the mean square error of the identified point pairs. But without some estimate of the sampling this seems a risky thresholding. In the manual for the Leica Cyclone they suggest manual inspection of the pair error histogram. If it has a Gaussian shape the fit is good. If there is a linear fall-off the match is probably bad. This seems plausible for me, but I've never seen it used in an algorithm.

210,How can I automatically adjust PID parameters on the fly?,"I have a simple servo system that uses a PID controller implemented in an MCU to perform the feedback. However, the properties of the system change dynamically, and so the PID parameters can never be tuned for all circumstances.
My robot is a light weight arm with back-drivable electric motors, similar to this one:

The arm performs several tasks, including picking up heavy weights, pushing and pulling objects across the desk. Each of these tasks requires different PID tuning parameters which I cannot easily predict.
What I would really like is for some higher level function which can carefully adjust the parameters in response to the arm's behaviour. For example, if it notices that the arm is oscillating, it might reduce P and increase D. Or if it noticed that the arm wasn't reaching its target, it might increase I.
Do such algorithms exist? I would be happy even if the algorithm didn't perfect the parameters immediately. E.G. the arm could oscillate a few times before the parameters were adjusted to their new values.

237,How to calculate serial speed and buffer requirements for PC to microcontroller communications?,"A common scenario is to have a PC that sends commands to a microcontroller via RS232.  My PC program is sending commands (each of which are composed of multiple bytes) as fast as it can to a small robot.  The microcontroller on the robot is a Parallax Propellor.
I have noticed that if I don't process bytes quickly enough on the microcontroller side of things, it can very quickly overflow the default buffers in the popular serial port drivers that are available for the Propellor. (The buffers are generally anywhere from 16 to 256 bytes).  I can arbitrarily increase these buffers or create my own larger circular buffer, but I would like to have a more methodical approach to determining appropriate size requirements and/or the minimal amount of time I can wait before pulling bytes out of the serial port driver buffer.
At 1st glance:

115200 == 115.2 bits per millisecond == ~12.8 bytes per millisecond (assuming 1 stop bit)

1) Is that a valid way to calculate timing for serial transmissions?
Also, given my specific setup:

PC Program <--> Bluetooth Serial Profile Driver <--> Bluetooth Transceiver <-*-> BlueSMIRF Wireless Modem <--> Parallax Propellor Program

2) What is the maximum amount of data I can send for a given period of time consistently without eventually running in to problems?
Maybe I'm over complicating things, but it seems like there are potentially multiple buffers involved in the transmission chain above.  How do others commonly deal with this? Do they throttle the PC sending to a known safe rate? Implement flow control?  If implementing flow control, how does that affect bandwidth and response times?
(If it matters, my experiment is to use a joystick on the PC to control multiple servos with instant reaction to the joystick movements. So every small movement of the joystick results in multiple commands being sent to the microcontroller. The commands are not just simple positional commands though, they also involve acceleration/deacceleration of servos over time and this is the reason that the microcontroller spends a significant amount of clock cycles before processing new bytes.)

Can someone please explain to me the concepts and theories behind building the beacon and it's accompanying receiver (suitable for connection to an Arduino via any digital or analog method) and achieving, say, a 4"" or better horizontal and vertical accuracy within a 50' sphere?

Take an articulated 6-axis robot arm as shown below, with attached cable (red), fixed at points X (before axis A4) and Y (after axis A6).

The cable will limit the range of movement for the robot. It can stretch and bend only to some extend, but something like a full 360 turn of axis A4, with all other axes remaining as they are in the picture, will tie the cable around the arm and rip it off.
If joint A5 is at 0, then A4 and A6 can still move the full 360, but they cannot diverge too much from each other, as that would twist the cable. If A5 is tilted, the relationship becomes even more complicated.
How can you express such a constraint?  
It is not a simple joint constraint, where you can independently limit the range of the joints, and it is also not a positional constraint, where you can define a region the robot must not enter.

The 6 variables tracked by the Kalman Filter are X, Y, Heading, Distance Scaling (calibration of the distance encoder), Steer Calibration (offset of the steer encoder), and finally a bearing calibration of a rotating laser. 
With this kind of system we put together a vehicle give it a known good location with plenty of landmarks, drive it around a bit, and end up with a well calibrated vehicle that can drive extended distances reliably with few landmarks. Its simple and it works great. Over time if an encoder drifts it will automatically follow the drift and adjust. 
We are now attempting to apply the same principles to a robot with multiple steer and drive wheels. In this case the vehicle will be able to move in any direction, spin in place, etc. . Each steer/drive wheel will have its own steer and distance encoder that each need to be calibrated. 
Can I expect to get the same kind of reliability and performance out of the more complex system? Are there any common pitfalls to look out for when expanding a kalman filter to include more variables? Is there a risk of it settling on sub-optimal values?

361,Programming a line following robot with reinforcement learning,"I am considering programming a line following robot using reinforcement learning algorithms. The question I am pondering over is how can I get the algorithm to learn navigating through any arbitrary path?
Having followed the Sutton & Barto Book for reinforcement learning, I did solve an exercise problem involving a racetrack where in the car agent learnt not to go off the track and regulate its speed. However, that exercise problem got the agent to learn how to navigate the track it trained on.
Is it in the scope of reinforcement learning to get a robot to navigate arbitrary paths? Does the agent absolutely have to have a map of the race circuit or path? What parameters could I possibly use for my state space?

382,How to fuse linear and angular data from sensors,"My team and I are setting up an outdoor robot that has encoders, a commercial-grade IMU, and GPS sensor. The robot has a basic tank drive, so the encoders sufficiently supply ticks from the left and right wheels. The IMU gives roll, pitch, yaw, and linear accelerations in x, y, and z. We could later add other IMUs, which would give redundancy, but could also additionally provide angular rates of roll, pitch, and yaw. The GPS publishes global x, y, and z coordinates.
Knowing the robot's x y position and heading will useful for the robot to localize and map out it's environment to navigate. The robot's velocity could also be useful for making smooth movement decisions. It's a ground-based robot, so we don't care too much about the z axis. The robot also has a lidar sensor and a camera--so roll and pitch will be useful for transforming the lidar and camera data for better orientation. 
I'm trying to figure out how to fuse all these numbers together in a way that optimally takes advantage of all sensors' accuracy. Right now we're using a Kalman filter to generate an estimate of  with the simple transition matrix:
[[1, dt, .5*dt*dt, 0,  0,        0],
 [0,  1,       dt, 0,  0,        0],
 [0,  0,        1, 0,  0,        0],
 [0,  0,        0, 1, dt, .5*dt*dt],
 [0,  0,        0, 0,  1,       dt],
 [0,  0,        0, 0,  0,        1]]

The filter estimates state exclusively based on the accelerations provided by the IMU. (The IMU isn't the best quality; within about 30 seconds it will show the robot (at rest) drifting a good 20 meters from its initial location.) I want to know out how to use roll, pitch, and yaw from the IMU, and potentially roll, pitch, and yaw rates, encoder data from the wheels, and GPS data to improve the state estimate. 
Using a bit of math, we can use the two encoders to generate x, y, and heading information on the robot, as well as linear and angular velocities. The encoders are very accurate, but they can be susceptible to slippage on an outdoor field. 
It seems to me that there are two separate sets of data here, which are difficult to fuse:

Estimates of x, x-vel, x-accel, y, y-vel, y-accel
Estimates of roll, pitch, yaw, and rates of roll, pitch, and yaw

Even though there's crossover between these two sets, I'm having trouble reasoning about how to put them together. For example, if the robot is going  at a constant speed, the direction of robot, determined by its x-vel and y-vel, will be the same as its yaw. Although, if the robot is at rest, the yaw cannot be accurately determined by the x and y velocities. Also, data provided by the encoders, translated to angular velocity, could  be an update to the yaw rate... but how could an update to the yaw rate end up providing better positional estimates?
Does it make sense to put all 12 numbers into the same filter, or are they normally kept separate? Is there already a well-developed way of dealing with this type of problem?

I was hoping to use several (3-6) 5 W 18650 battery boxes to power them, but the smallest motors would use 2.5 W each, so 1 battery box can only power two. The larger servos, obviously, use even more current, so this plan of using a small number of 18650's becomes infeasible.
There is not enough room on the robot for a 12 V car battery, and adding one would require recalculating the sizes of the servomotors that would be needed. Furthermore, I am not sure how to convert the 12 V it gives down to 5 V for the servomotors.
P.S. What about the stall current of the motors? Should the power supply be able to supply the stall current of all the motors it supplies (at the same time) or just the working current? Should I use a fuse to handle when (if?) the servomotors stall? Should I use a fuse or a circuit breaker? Do they make 5 V fuses? If so, where can I get one?

436,How do I model a robot?,"The answers I received to the question on training a line following robot using reinforcement learning techniques, got me to think on how to train a robot. I believe there are essentially two ways -

Train the physical robot.
Model the robot and simulate the training.
Did I miss something?

Approach 2 is definitely the better approach. However, a priori knowledge of the motion (response), a certain PWM signal (stimulus) would cause when the robot is in a given state is required. The motion caused by a PWM signal may depend on the (1) current battery voltage, (2) the mass of the robot and the (3) current velocity (did I miss something?).
How do I model such a robot? And how do I model it quick? If I change the battery or add a few boards and other peripherals and change the mass of the robot, I would have to remodel and retrain the robot. Can I do this by providing some random stimulus PWMs and measuring the response?

As much as I tune these parameters, though, I am never able to get results that are even remotely close to what can be obtained using an active sensor such as the Kinect.
The reason why I want that is because very often point clouds corresponding to adjacent regions don't have enough overlap for me to obtain a match, so reconstruction is severely impaired.

478,How can I optimise control parameters for a stepper motor?,"As an industrial roboticist I spent most of my time working with robots and machines which used brushless DC motors or linear motors, so I have lots of experience tuning PID parameters for those motors.
Now I'm moving to doing hobby robotics using stepper motors (I'm building my first RepRap), I wonder what I need to do differently. 
Obviously without encoder feedback I need to be much more conservative in requests to the motor, making sure that I always keep within the envelope of what is possible, but how do I find out whether my tuning is optimal, sub optimal or (worst case) marginally unstable?
Obviously for a given load (in my case the extruder head) I need to generate step pulse trains which cause a demanded acceleration and speed that the motor can cope with, without missing steps.
My first thought is to do some test sequences, for instance:

Home motor precisely on it's home sensor.
Move $C$ steps away from home slowly.
Move $M$ steps away from home with a conservative move profile.
Move $N$ steps with the test acceleration/speed profile.
Move $N$ steps back to the start of the test move with a conservative move profile.
Move $M$ steps back to home with a conservative move profile.
Move $C$ steps back to the home sensor slowly, verifying that the sensor is triggered at the correct position.
Repeat for a variety of $N$, $M$, acceleration/speed & load profiles.

This should reliably detect missed steps in the test profile move, but it does seem like an awfully large space to test through however, so I wonder what techniques have been developed to optimise stepper motor control parameters.

479,Particle filters: How to do resampling?,"I understand the basic principle of a particle filter and tried to implement one. However, I got hung up on the resampling part. 
Theoretically speaking, it is quite simple: From the old (and weighted) set of particles, draw a new set of particles with replacement. While doing so, favor those particles that have high weights. Particles with high weights get drawn more often and particles with low weights less often. Perhaps only once or not at all. After resampling, all weights get assigned the same weight.
My first idea on how to implement this was essentially this:

Normalize the weights
Multiply each weight by the total number of particles
Round those scaled weights to the nearest integer (e.g. with  in Python)

Now I should know how often to draw each particle, but due to the roundoff errors, I end up having less particles than before the resampling step. 
The Question: How do I ""fill up"" the missing particles in order to get to the same number of particles as before the resampling step? Or, in case I am completely off track here, how do I resample correctly?

project(x(r), x(lmk)) should have been project(x(r), x(lmk_idx)) and is now corrected above.  
K goes singular after a little while, but not immediately.  I think it's around 20 seconds or so.  I'll try the changes @josh suggested when I get home tonight and post the results.
Update 1:
My simulation first observes 2 landmarks, so K is 7x2.  (P(rl,rl) * E_rl') * inv( Z ) results in a 5x2 matrix, so it can't be added to x in the next line.  
K becomes singular after 4.82 seconds, with measurements at 50Hz (241 steps).  Following the advice here (), I tried K = (P(:, rl) * E_rl')/Z which results in 250 steps before a warning about K being singular is produced.

521,Computing the Jacobian matrix for Inverse Kinematics,"When computing the Jacobian matrix for solving an Inverse Kinematic analytically,I read from many places that I could use this formula to create each of the columns of a joint in the Jacobian matrix:

Such that $a'$ is the rotation axis in world space, $r'$ is the pivot point in world space, and $e_{pos}$ is the position of end effector in world space.
However, I don't understand how this can work when the joints have more than one DOFs. Take the following as example:

The $\theta$ are the rotational DOF, the $e$ is the end effector, the $g$ is the goal of the end effector, the $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$ are the joints.
First, if I were to compute the Jacobian matrix based on the formula above for the diagram, I will get something like this:
$$J=\begin{bmatrix}
((0,0,1)\times \vec { e } )_{ x } & ((0,0,1)\times (\vec { e } -\vec { P_{ 1 } } ))_{ x } & ((0,0,1)\times (\vec { e } -\vec { P_{ 2 } } ))_{ x } \\ ((0,0,1)\times \vec { e } )_{ y } & ((0,0,1)\times (\vec { e } -\vec { P_{ 1 } } ))_{ y } & ((0,0,1)\times (\vec { e } -\vec { P_{ 2 } } ))_{ y } \\ ((0,0,1)\times \vec { e } )_{ z } & ((0,0,1)\times (\vec { e } -\vec { P_{ 1 } } ))_{ z } & ((0,0,1)\times (\vec { e } -\vec { P_{ 2 } } ))_{ z } \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} $$
This is assumed that all the rotation axes are $(0,0,1)$ and all of them only have one rotational DOF. So, I believe each column is for one DOF, in this case, the $\theta_\#$.
Now, here's the problem: What if all the joints have full 6 DOFs? Say now, for every joint, I have rotational DOFs in all axes, $\theta_x$, $\theta_y$ and $\theta_z$, and also translational DOFs in all axes, $t_x$, $t_y$ and $t_z$.
To make my question clearer, suppose if I were to ""forcefully"" apply the formula above to all the DOFs of all the joints, then I probably will get a Jacobian matrix like this:

(click for full size)
But this is incredibly weird because all the 6 columns of the DOF for every joint is repeating the same thing.
How can I use the same formula to build the Jacobian matrix with all the DOFs? How would the Jacobian matrix look like in this case?

This is clearly due to the fact that the continuous tracks have so many moving parts that having identical friction forces on each track is hard to get.
How do I get them to move the same speed? Should they be moving the same speed given the same servo angle regardless of the friction and the Vex 269 Motors just aren't strong enough (meaning I should use the Vex 369 or some other more powerful motor)?

A reasonably unlimited source of power (let's say it is a solar powered robot placed on a space station that faces the sun at all times with no ceiling)

649,Does RRT* guarantee asymptotic optimality for a minimum clearance cost metric?,"The optimal sampling-based motion planning algorithm $\text{RRT}^*$ (described in this paper) has been shown to yield collision-free paths which converge to the optimal path as planning time increases. However, as far as I can see, the optimality proofs and experiments have assumed that the path cost metric is Euclidean distance in configuration space. Can $\text{RRT}^*$ also yield optimality properties for other path quality metrics, such as maximizing minimum clearance from obstacles throughout the path?
To define minimum clearance: for simplicity, we can consider a point robot moving about in Euclidean space. For any configuration $q$ that is in the collision-free configuration space, define a function $d(q)$ which returns the distance between the robot and the nearest C-obstacle. For a path $\sigma$, the minimum clearance $\text{min_clear}(\sigma)$ is the minimum value of $d(q)$ for all $q \in \sigma$. In optimal motion planning, one might wish to maximize minimum clearance from obstacles along a path. This would mean defining some cost metric $c(\sigma)$ such that $c$ increases as the minimum clearance decreases. One simple function would be $c(\sigma) = \exp(-\text{min_clear}(\sigma))$.
In the first paper introducing $\text{RRT}^*$, several assumptions are made about the path cost metric so that the proofs hold; one of the assumptions concerned additivity of the cost metric, which doesn't hold for the above minimum clearance metric. However, in the more recent journal article describing the algorithm, several of the prior assumptions weren't listed, and it seemed that the minimum clearance cost metric might also be optimized by the algorithm.
Does anyone know if the proofs for the optimality of $\text{RRT}^*$ can hold for a minimum clearance cost metric (perhaps not the one I gave above, but another which has the same minimum), or if experiments have been performed to support the algorithm's usefulness for such a metric?

689,"Cable routing in theta, x, y motion control system. Better inside or outside?","I'm building a motion control platform with 3 DoF: 1 axis of rotation (theta) and 2 cartesian (x,y). In most applications, like wrist actuation, you have an X-Y stage with a rotating servo as the stage's payload. This configuration works well since little of the power and data wiring needs to transit to the non-linear moving portion of the platform. 
For my inverted application, the stackup is reversed. The rotating axis comes first (from the mounting plane) with the stage connected as the rotating platform's payload. Now nearly all of the wiring (power, command, sensor, and otherwise) must be routed to the non-linearly moving section.
I can see two broad approaches: 

The inside track, I route the cabling through the center of rotation.
The outside track, I route the cabling around outside the outer diameter of the rotating platform.

Mathematically, I can see that (1) results in minimum cable length, but maximum torsional loading, while (2) results in maximum cable length, but minimum torsional loading on the wires.
Having limited experience with cable routing (and the associated carriers, strategies, and products) in non-linear applications, my question is...
...which approach is better in practice?
Cost isn't really the issue here. I'm more interested in reliability, ease of construction, availability of commercial components (says something about the popularity of the technique), etc...
e.g. the generic concepts behind why you pick one over the other. 
...of course, if you have some part numbers for me I wouldn't be upset <-- I know I'm not supposed ask that here ;-)

690,Noise in motion and measurement models,"When using an EKF for SLAM, I often see the motion and measurement models being described as having some noise term.  
This makes sense to me if you're doing a simulation, where you need to add noise to a simulated measurement to make it stochastic.  But what about when using real robot data?  Is the noise already in the measurement and thus does not need to be added, or does the noise matrix mean something else?
For example, in Probabilistic Robotics (on page 319), there is a measurement model: $z_t^i = h(y,j) + Q_t$, where $Q_t$ is a noise covariance.  Does $Q_t$ need to be calculated when working with real data?

725,Least squares map joining,"There is a lot of background here, scroll to the bottom for the question
I am trying out the map joining algorithm described in How Far is SLAM From a Linear Least Squares Problem; specifically, formula (36).  The code I have written seems to always take the values of the second map for landmark positions.  My question is, am I understanding the text correctly or am I making some sort of error. I'll try to explain the formulas as I understand them and show how my code implements that.  I'm trying to do the simple case of joining just two local maps. 
From the paper (36) says joining two local maps is finding the a state vector $X_{join,rel}$ that minimizes:
$$
\sum_{j=1}^{k}(\hat{X_j^L} - H_{j,rel}(X_{join,rel}))^T(P_j^L)^{-1}(\hat{X_j^L} - H_{j,rel}(X_{join,rel}))
$$
Expanded for two local maps $\hat{X_1^L}$ and $\hat{X_2^L}$ I have:
$$
(\hat{X_1^L} - H_{j,rel}(X_{join,rel}))^T(P_1^L)^{-1}(\hat{X_1^L} - H_{j,rel}(X_{join,rel})) + (\hat{X_2^L} - H_{j,rel}(X_{join,rel}))^T(P_2^L)^{-1}(\hat{X_2^L} - H_{j,rel}(X_{join,rel}))
$$
As I understand it, a submap can be viewed as an integrated observation for a global map, so $P^L_j$ is noise associated with the submap (as opposed to being the process noise in the EKF I used to make the submap, which may or may not be different). 
The vector $X_{join,rel}$ is the pose from the first map, the pose from the second map and the union of the landmarks in both maps.
The function $H_{j,rel}$ is:
$$
\begin{bmatrix} X_{r_{je}}^{r_{(j-1)e}}\\
                 \phi_{r_{je}}^{r_{(j-1)e}}\\
                 R(\phi_{r_{(j-1)e}}^{r_{m_{j1}e}})
                        (X^{r_{m_{j1}e}}_{f_{j1}} -
                         X^{r_{m_{j1}e}}_{r_{(j-1)e}})\\.\\.\\.\\
                 R(\phi_{r_{(j-1)e}}^{r_{m_{jl}e}})
                        (X^{r_{m_{jl}e}}_{f_{jl}} -
                         X^{r_{m_{jl}e}}_{r_{(j-1)e}})\\
                         X_{f_{j(l+1)}}^{r_{j-1e}}\\
                         .\\.\\.\\
                         X_{f_{jn}}^{r_{j-1e}}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
I'm not convinced that my assessment below is correct:
The first two elements are the robot's pose in the reference frame of the previous map.  For example, for map 1, the pose will be in initial frame at $t_0$; for map 2, it will be in the frame of map 1.
The next group of elements are those common to map 1 and map 2, which are transformed into map 1's reference frame.
The final rows are the features unique to map 2, in the frame of the first map.
My matlab implementation is as follows:

I am using the optimization toolbox to find the minimum of the fitness function described above.  The fitness function itself is pretty straightforward I think.  The function H returns the vector H described above.

Cons: last connection has to travel length of robot, each processor has to spend cycles retransmitting messages

What are ways for dealing with the lag?  I would think one could take a lot of measurements and model the compass response.  However, this seems problematic since it's rate-dependent and I don't know the instantaneous rate.

Update: I had almost given up hope, until someone at Homebrew Robotics suggested using the Maxon motor finder.
If you just type in my given torque and speed, it returns 3 motors, but they're all over powered because the search interprets your specs as a continuous operating point, whereas my robot will only need that much power 20% of the time, and maybe for 1 second max.

I also know that there have been research studies done to support this theory using MRI scans. 
The effect is an important consideration when designing robotic systems that can successfully interact with people. In order to avoid the uncanny valley, designers often create robots that are very far from humanlike. For example, many therapeutic robots (Paro, Keepon) are designed to look like animals or be ""cute"" and non-threatening.
Other therapeutic robots, like Kaspar, look very humanlike. Kaspar is an excellent example of the uncanny valley, since when I look at Kaspar it creeps me out. However, people on the autism spectrum may not experience Kaspar the same way that I do. And according to Shahbaz's comment, children with autism have responded well to Kaspar.
In the application of therapeutic robots for people on the autism spectrum, some of the basic principles of human-robot interaction (like the uncanny valley) may not be valid. I can find some anecdotal evidence (with Google) that people on the autism spectrum don't experience the uncanny valley, but so far I haven't seen any real studies in that area.

I am considering an architecture in two parts:

A set of realtime controllers (either Raspeberry Pis running an RTOS such as Xenomai or bare metal microcontrollers) to control the arm motors and encoders.  Let us call these machines RTx, with x=1,2,3 depending on the number of microcontrollers.  This control loop will run at 200Hz.
A powerful vanilla linux machine running ROS to compute SLAM, mocap, and execute high-level logic (decide the robots task and compute the motors' desired position and speed).  This control loop will run at 30Hz.

I know my framework needs to be scalable to account for more motors, more sensors, more PCs (eg. for external mocap). 
My main problem is to decide how to have the different RTx communicate with PC1. I have looked at papers related to robots architecture (e.g. HRP2), most often they describe the high level control architecture but I have yet to find information on how to have the low level communicate with the high level and in a scalable way. Did I miss something?
In order to connect the fast RT machines ensuring the motor control with PC1, I have considered TCP/IP, CAN and UART:

TCP/IP: not deterministic but easy to put in place. Is non determinism a real issue (as it will only be used at at slow speed 30Hz anyways)?
CAN: slow, very reliable, targeted to cars ( have seen there are some exemples using CAN with robots but it looked exotic)
UART: if I had only had one RT machine for motor control I would have considered UART but I guess this port does not scale well with many RTx
Is TCP/IP really a no go because of its non-deterministic characteristics? It is so easy to use

At the moment no solution really seems obvious to me. And as I can find no serious robot example using a specific reliable and scalable solution, I do not feel confident to make a choice. 
Does anyone have a clear view on this point or literature to point to?  Are there typical or mainstream communication solutions used on robots?

The robot is carrying water, not exactly the same amount each time, so it will not weigh the same. Therefore it might not be the same amount of steps in the stepper-motor each time.
Here I have some ideas that might work, though I am a beginner, and don't know what's the best solution.

Have a knob it will hit at the middle of the track, telling program to delay for a given time

However, few robotics researchers are probably proficient with Maya. (I know I'm not!)
Is there already some kind of 3D posing tool for robotics that is a standard? The only things I have seen so far that comes close is the Pose Utility in RoboPlus and Choregraphe for the Nao, but both programs seem limited to particular robots and don't appear to be extendable to Hubo.

I would like to be able to use only tooling that I can make myself, so I can rapidly iterate on the tooling as production problems are discovered.
I know that typical injection-mold ""hard tooling"" is created using electrical discharge machining, which requires first CNCing a carbon positive and then using that as an electrode to spark-burn out a negative mold from hard steel.
However, I do not have the equipment for EDM. Instead, I would prefer to directly CNC the negative mold. I know that a soft enough steel to be CNCed will not last very long as an injection mold, but like I said, my run size is tiny, and I am ok with making a new mold every 500 units or so if necessary.
I am open to buying an endmill that is diamond-tipped, to work with harder steel, but then the limitation will probably be how much torque the CNC can produce on the endmill.

Now I want to try a ""full"" optimal control method, starting with an iterative LQR method (which I found implemented here )
The method requires one dynamic function and one cost function ( is the motor torque (one motor only)):

Some info on the pendulum: the origin of my system is where the pendulum is fixed to the ground. The angle theta is zero in the stable position (and pi in the unstable/goal position).
m is the bob mass, l is the rod length, d is a damping factor (for simplicity I put m=1, l=1, d=0.3)
My cost is simple: penalize the control + the final error.

tspan = [0 10];
dt = 0.01;
steps = floor(tspan(2)/dt);
x0 = [pi/4; 0];
umin = -3; umax = 3;
[x_, u_, L, J_opt ] = ilqg_det(@ilqr_fnDyn, @ilqr_fnCost, dt, steps, x0, 0, umin, umax);

I am kind of at a lost as to how to mount all of these together.  I would like to mount the forearm directly to the pulley and then the two parallel arms (comprising the upper-arm) sandwich the top of the pulley and the lower part of the forearm.

I'm working on a UAV project, and while the good people over at DIY Drones have been very helpful, this question is a little less drone-related and a little more general robotics/electronics. Essentially, I'm looking at options for ground stations, and my current rough plan is something like this:
I have a PC joystick with a broken sensor in the base, which I plan to dismantle, separate the handle from the base, insert an Arduino Nano into the (mostly hollow) handle and hook it up to all the buttons and the hat thumbstick. Then, where the hole is that used to accept the stem to the base, I fit a bracket that runs horizontally to hold a smallish touchscreen (think Razer's Project Fiona tablet with only one stick), behind which is mounted a Raspberry Pi. The Nano talks to the RPi over USB as a HID input. The RPi will be running some custom software to display telemetry and other data sent down from the UAV.
My main question whether that Nano would have enough power to run the XBee that provides the telemetry link without causing lag in the control inputs. It's worth mentioning that the UAV will be doing fly-by-wire moderation, so slight stutters won't result in wobbly flying, but serious interruptions will still be problematic - and annoying. It's also worth mentioning that this will only be used as a simplified ""guiding hand"" control; there will ALWAYS be a regular remote control available (not least because of EU flight regulations) so this is just for when I don't want to use that. If that Nano won't do, what are my options? My first thought is to get a second Nano and get that to drive the XBee (the RPi has two USB ports after all) but there may well be a better way.

907,Calibrate a 2d scanner mounted on a rotary axis,"A 2d laser scanner is mounted on a rotary axis. I wish to determine the transformation matrix from the center of the axis to the center of the scanner, using only the input from the scanner and the angle of rotation.

The 2d scanner itself is assumed to be calibrated, it will accurately measure the position of any object inside the plane of the laser, in regards to the scanner origin.
The rotary axis is calibrated as well, it will accurately measure the angle of its own movement.
The scanner is aligned and mounted close to the center of rotation, but the exact offset is unknown, and may drift over time.
Assume it is impractical to measure the position and orientation of the scanner directly. 
I am looking for a way to determine the exact values for the 6 degrees of offset the scanner may have in relation to the axis, determined solely on the 2d information from the scanner and the rotation angle from the axis.

I am mainly interested in the 4 offsets depicted here, since the other two do not matter in regard to generating a consistent 3d point cloud from the input data.
By scanning a known calibration object, it should be possible to determine these offsets. What are the mathematical formulas for this? 
What sort of calibration information is required at a minimum?
Is it for example possible to determine all parameters simply by scanning a flat surface, knowing nothing about the surface except that it is flat?
(The transformation matrix from rotation axis to world is unknown as well, but that one is trivial to determine once the transformation from axis to camera is known.)

Example

On the left the camera is placed exactly on the rotational axis.  The camera scans a planar object with reference points A B and C. Based on the laser distance measurements and the angle of the axis, this planar object can be reconstructed.
On the right, the camera has an unknown offset to the axis. It scans the same object. If the point cloud is constructed without knowing this offset, the planar surface maps to a curved surface.

Is there just very little contact between screw thread and rail thread vs. regular screw hole threads?  Or would the screw want to rest angled somewhat- and then the head would not be flush with the rim of the rail?  Or would the screw deform the aluminum rail if over-torqued?

922,How do I design for a target speed?,"I need to make an omni wheeled robot platform (4 wheels), which should go at a minimum speed of 15 cm/s.  I have an idea for the design, but since this is my first time doing something like this I have made a lot of assumptions. 
I decided to choose the TGY-S4505B servos as my motor system. I intend to attach these servos to FXA308B wheels. Finally, I intend to power my servos with one Turnigy LSD 6.0V 2300mAh Ni-MH Flat Receiver Packs (not sure if LiPo is a better choice). I need to be able to run the servos continuously for roughly 8 minutes. You can ignore the microcontroller and other stuff, relatively speaking they will consume much less power. The robot will have four wheels (thus, four servos).
The basic specifications of each servo is:

Type: Analog
Gear train: Plastic
Bearings: Dual
Motor Type: Carbon Brushed
Weight: 40g (1.41oz)
Lead: 30cm
Torque: 3.9kg.cm @ 4.8v / 4.8kg.cm @ 6v
Speed: 0.13sec 60@ 4.8v / 0.10 60 @ 6v

So based on my battery pack, I will be running the servos at 6V. That gives me a speed of 60 degrees per 0.10 seconds. I plan on modifying these servos for continuous rotation, and connected them directly to the wheel. Since the wheel has a diameter of ~5 cm, it has a circumference of ~15 cm. Based on these specs, it seems to me that my robot can move at roughly 15 cm/0.6 seconds, or 25 cm/s (quite fast actually). I don't intend to run it constantly at that speed, so in the 8 minute run, assume my average speed to be 20 cm/s.
Are these assumptions reasonable, and are the calculations correct?  I would really appreciate any insight, advice, recommendations, and criticisms you may have.

952,What's an efficient way to visit every reachable space on a grid with unknown obstacles?,"I'm trying to create a map of the obstacles in a fairly coarse 2D grid space, using exploration.  I detect obstacles by attempting to move from one space to an adjacent space, and if that fails then there's an obstacle in the destination space (there is no concept of a rangefinding sensor in this problem).
 (for example)
The process is complete when all the reachable squares have been visited.  In other words, some spaces might be completely unreachable even if they don't have obstacles because they're surrounded.  This is expected.
In the simplest case, I could use a DFS algorithm, but I'm worried that this will take an excessively long time to complete  the robot will spend more time backtracking than exploring new territory.  I expect this to be especially problematic when attempting to reach the unreachable squares, because the robot will exhaust every option.
In the more sophisticated method, the proper thing to do seems to be Boustrophedon cell decomposition.

However, I can't seem to find a good description of the Boustrophedon cell decomposition algorithm (that is, a complete description in simple terms).  There are resources like this one, or this more general one on vertical cell decomposition but they don't offer much insight into the high-level algorithms nor the low-level data structures involved.
How can I visit (map) this grid efficiently?  If it exists, I would like an algorithm that performs better than $O(n^2)$ with respect to the total number of grid squares (i.e. better than $O(n^4)$ for an $n*n$ grid).

Does the same apply when using the odometry motion model (described in the same book, page 133), where robot motion is approximated by a rotation $\hat{\delta}_{rot1}$, a translation $\hat{\delta}$ and a second rotation $\hat{\delta}_{rot2}$ ? The corresponding equations are:
$\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ \theta \end{bmatrix}' = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ \theta \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} \hat{\delta}\text{cos}(\theta + \hat{\delta}_{rot1}) \\ \hat{\delta}\text{sin}(\theta + \hat{\delta}_{rot1}) \\ \hat{\delta}_{rot1} + \hat{\delta}_{rot2} \end{bmatrix}$.

965,Firmata over nRF24,"I'm having some technical problems... I'm trying to use Firmata for arduino but over nrf24, not over Serial interface. I have tested nRF24 communication and it's fine. I have also tested Firmata over Serial and it works. 
Base device is simple ""serial relay"". When it has data available on Serial, read it and send it over nRF24 network. If there is data available from network, read it and send it through Serial.
Node device is a bit complex. It has custom Standard Firmata where I have just added write and read override. 

Read override id handeled in  method in this way:
while(Firmata.available())
    Firmata.processInput();

// Handle network data and send it to Firmata process method
while(network.available()) {
    RF24NetworkHeader header;
    uint8_t data;
    network.read(header, &data, sizeof(uint8_t));
    Serial.print(data, DEC); Serial.print("" "");
    Firmata.processInputOverride(data);
    BlinkOnBoard(50);
}

currentMillis = millis();

Firmata processInputOverrride is little changed method of processInput where processInput reads data directly from FirmataSerial, and in this method we pass data down to method from network. This was tested and it should work fine.
Write method is overloaded in a different way. In Firmata.cpp I have added an method pointer that can be set to a custom method and used to send data using that custom method. I have then added custom method call after each of the FirmataSerial.write() call:
Firmata.h
...
size_t (*firmataSerialWriteOverride)(uint8_t);
...

void FirmataClass::printVersion(void) {
  FirmataSerial.write(REPORT_VERSION);
  FirmataSerial.write(FIRMATA_MAJOR_VERSION);
  FirmataSerial.write(FIRMATA_MINOR_VERSION);
  Firmata.firmataSerialWriteOverride(REPORT_VERSION);
  Firmata.firmataSerialWriteOverride(FIRMATA_MAJOR_VERSION);
  Firmata.firmataSerialWriteOverride(FIRMATA_MINOR_VERSION);
}

I have then set the overrided write method to a custom method that just writes byte to network instead of Serial.
size_t ssignal(uint8_t data) {
    RF24NetworkHeader header(BaseDevice);
    network.write(header, &data, sizeof(uint8_t));
}

void setup() {
...
Firmata.firmataSerialWriteOverride = ssignal;

All stages pass right (I guess) and then I don't get any response from Node when I request pin states

Why is it, apparently, so hard to build components with operating temperatures matching those on Mars, Europa, or in space?
Edit: None of the answers address my question thus far. I know that all parts, both electronic and mechanical, and greases and so on have relatively narrow working temperatures. My question is, why don't we build special cold metals and cold greases and cold chips that have their narrow operating temperature band at -100 C or whatever?
Valid answers could be: it's too expensive, insufficient science has been done to determine materials appropriate for such cold, such cold materials cannot be manufactured in the sweltering heat of planet Earth.

My original code for it was a simple servo controller on the arduino, and Scala code which would send servo commands over the wire.  I did all the Inverse Kinematics and Gait logic in Scala, and got it to walk: 3dof quadruped first gait.
My Gait logic in Scala was somewhat naive; it depended on the legs being in the right position at the beginning (one side extended fore and aft, the other side in toward each other).  The logic was simply translate all four feet backward by 1mm along y, and whenever a coxa angle became excessively rearward, stop and perform a little routine where that foot is lifted 10mm in z, then translated forward 60mm along y, and set back down.  Naive, but effective.
Now, I have rewritten my IK code in arduino C, and I'm trying to decide how to move forward with the Gait dynamics.  I've had a hard time finding good, easy to understand resources about gaits.  I do have some knowledge about the difference between dynamically stable gaits (like creep gaits) where the body is a stable tripod at all times and dynamically unstable gaits (walking, trotting), where two legs are off the ground at a time and the body is essentially falling forward into the advancing leg.
I had some thoughts about state machines and trying to calculate whether the body center falls within a triangle made by the remaining feet to decide which foot was safe to lift, but I'm not sure if these are ideas worth exploring.

It uses a CC2500 module for communicating with the robot.  The interface is designed in Visual Basic 6 and it allows us to set the port of the computer to which the transreceiver is connected. It is connected via a USB to RS232 port (USB side is connected to the computer).
We tried the settings as shown below and we get an error that the config is unsuccessful. We have tried the same settings in 4 different computers so far and it did not work.

It is designed using an Atmel 89S52.

998,Motors response different with high-frequency PWM,"We are making a junior soccer robot and we just got our brilliant motors from Maxon.
Setting the PWM timer to low-frequencies (around 39kHz or 156 kHz ) the robot acts as expected. But this produces some problems. 

It puts a heavy current on batteries (around 1.5A for 3 motors which is far too high).
The high current causes our motor drivers (L6203) to heat up very quickly and even heat-sinks won't help them.
The motors make such a bad sound as they are screaming and this is not normal.

In contrast when I configure the timer on high-frequencies (such as 1250 kHz or 10000 kHz) the current drops off to 0.2A which is ideal and the sounds quit down.
But this causes a problem that our 3 motors when set to run on their highest speed (PWM set to 255) don't run by the same rpm. like one of them runs slower than others making robot turn to a specific side and so our handling functions fail to work correctly.
Asking someone he told me that the drivers don't respond the same to frequencies thus resulting in different speeds and because on low frequencies the difference is very small I won't notice it but on higher frequencies the difference becomes bigger and noticeable.
So is there any workaround for this problem? or I should continue using low frequencies? 
PS: I'm using ATMEGA16 as the main controller with a 10 mHz external crystal.

999,"For servos, can it be implied that `Holding Torque = Operating Torque * 2` like with steppers?","I am following a guide that recommends using stepper motors and it has an approximate holding and operating torque. It says that if you don't know the operating torque, it is often half of the holding torque. I am adapting this to use with a servo and I was wondering can this same formula be used with a servo. My servo has approximately  of torque so does that mean that I can estimate the operating torque would be ~1 kg/cm?
A couple of things:

I know operating torque and holding torque are different. This is just a estimate-it isn't an exact science.
I know servos are harder to find their location (75 degrees, etc.) than to use a stepper and assume that it worked. I have external means of finding the location.

1005,Controlling the Power of a Solenoid,"I am trying to control the force of a solenoid. My current system has a bank of capacitors connected to a relay. In order to control the force (how hard I am trying to hit the object) I am increasing or decreasing the the time the relay is on. The problem is this works but it either hits with too much force or way too much force. I can turn the relay on for 5 ms or more. If I try to turn it on for 1 ms it does not even respond. (I am using a mechanical relay.)
I would like to have more control on how much of the energy I discharge so I can control how hard/soft the solenoid moves (say discharge only 10 percent of the total energy stored so it hits slower). While searching I found out about Solid State Relays which according to wikipedia can be switched on an off way faster that mechanical relay (of the order of microseconds to milliseconds).
So my question is am I on the right track? or is there something better to achieve what I am trying to achieve?

1006,Taylor Series expansion for EKF,"In Probablistic Robotics by S. Thrun, in the first section on the Extended Kalman Filter, it talks about linearizing the process and observation models using first order Taylor expansion.  
Equation 3.51 states:
$g(u_t,x_{t-1}) \approx g(u_t,\mu_{t-1}) + g\prime(u_t, \mu_{t-1})(x_{t-1} - \mu_{t-1})$
I think $\mu_{t-1}$ is the state estimate from the last time step.  My question is: what is $x_{t-1}$?  
Also, the EKF algorithm following this (on table 3.3) does not use the factor $(x_{t-1} - \mu_{t-1})$ anywhere, only $g\prime(u_t, \mu_{t-1})$.  So after being confused about $x_{t-1}$, I'm left wondering where it went in the algorithm.

To accomplish this, I'm looking to charge all the batteries at once using this 6.4V LiFePO4 smart charger. From a simplistic standpoint, the resulting voltage should be correct and this should work fine. However, I know (from a previous question) that LiFePO4 battery chargers are a bit more complex then a basic voltage supply and check. Would the setup I've described work correctly? And in general, will a LiFePO4 smart charger be able to charge several batteries of the correct voltage at the same time so long as it doesn't try to charge them at too high an amperage? Or does a LiFePO4 battery also have a minimum amperage cutoff point to charge such that trying to charge more than one battery at a time will cause problems? Any other issues I didn't mention?

I'm just enthusiastic by seeing some sci-fi videos which show robots carry goods and materials in a crowded place. And they really don't follow a physical line. They sense obstacles, depth, etc.  
I would like to build one such robot which follows a specific (virtual)  path from point A to B.
I have tried a couple of things:

Using a magnetic ""Hall effect"" sensor on the robot and wire carrying current (beneath the table). The problem here was that the vicinity of the hall effect sensor is so small (< 2cms) that it is very difficult to judge whether robot is on the line or off the line. Even using series of magnets couldn't solve this issue, as my table is 1 inch thick. So this idea flopped :P
Using an ultraviolet paint (on a line) and using UV leds on the robot as sensors. This will give more Zig-Zag motion for the robot. And due to potential threats of using UV light source, even this idea flopped :P

I finally thought of having a camera on top and using image processing algorithms to see whether robot is on the line or diverging.
Is there any better solution than this? Really looking for some creative and simple solutions. :)

1033,What is the actual physical actuated quantity when controlling the position of a servo?,"I'm trying to learn about servo control. I have seen that the most generic position control method for servos is PID, where the control input is position error. However, I am not sure about what is the actuated quantity. I am guessing that it is one of:

Voltage applied to the motor
Current applied to the motor

I am then guessing that the actuated quantity gets turned into one of:

Torque that the motor exerts
Angular velocity that the motor runs at

I haven't been able to get my hands on and explicitly control a physical servo so I cannot confirm that the actuated quantity is any of these. I know very little of the electronics that controls the motor. It might well be that the controlled quantities are different for different series servos. 
My bet is on torque control. However, assume that the servo is holding a weight at a distance (so it is acting against gravity), which means an approximately constant torque load. In this case, if the position error is zero and the servo is at rest, then each of P, I and D components are zero, which means the exerted torque is zero. This would cause the weight to sink, which is countered by the error in its position causing P,I components to increase. Wouldn't this situation cause the lifted weight to oscillate and balance at a constant position which is significantly different from the goal position? This isn't the case with the videos of servos I have seen lifting weights. Or is this the case and friction is smoothing everything out? Please help me understand.

I upgraded the servos to some geared DC motors with 8-bit encoders with the goal having the robot drive around while balancing.   
I'm kind of stuck on how to program it to drive around while still balancing.  I think one way would be to just have the control input to the motors act sort of like pushing it.  So the robot would be momentarily unbalanced in the direction I want it to travel.  That seems kind of clumsy to me though.  There must be a better way of doing?  I think I need to combine the dynamic model for the balancer with the differential drive but this is a bit beyond the control theory that I know.  
Update 
From Anorton's answer I have a good looking state matrix now. 
Now about pole placement:  The A matrix will will have to be 4x4 based on the new state vector.  And B will then have to be a 4x2 matrix since I can only control the left/right wheel torque (u = 2x1 vector).  
I may need to read more about this but is there a systematic way to determine the A matrix by pole placement?  It seems to me for this example and even more complicated examples, determining A by guess and check would be very difficult.  
Update #2
After a bit of reading I think I understand it now.  I still need the dynamics of the robot to determine the A matrix.  Once I have that I can do the pole placement using matlab or octave.

Yet more common English orientation descriptors are frequently either too wordy or too imprecise for rapid selection (e.g.,  ""front-facing camera on robot 1's right front shoulder"" is too wordy; but ""front""/ ""forward"" is too imprecise - is the camera on the leading edge or is it pointing forward?)
In the naval and aeronautical fields vehicle locations are generically talked about as fore, aft (or stern), port, and starboard. While, direction of movement that is relative to the vehicle is frequently given in reference to a clockface (e.g., forward of the the fore would be ""at 12"", rear of the aft would be ""at 6"", while right of starboard and left of port would be ""at 3"" and ""at 9"", respectively).  This language supports rapid human communication that is more precise than terms such as ""front"" and ""forward"".  Are there equivalent terms within mobile robotics?

But my task currently requires the inversion of some of them. Basically, I would have a part of the chain that is read from the end-effector to the origin, using the same links (and thus the same parameters). Is it possible? How to do so?

Please notice that this is not related to the inversion of the kinematic chain. It's more basic: I want to find the dh parameters of the inverted forward kinematic chain.
Let's put it simple: I have dh parameters for a 2 link planar chain from joint 0 to joint 1, so I can compute its direct kinematics. But what if I want to compute the direct kinematics from joint 1 to joint 0?
Given DH parameters [ $A_i, D_i, \alpha_i, \theta_i$], I can retrieve the transform matrix with this formula:
$G = \left[\begin{matrix}
cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta)*cos(\alpha) &  sin(\theta)*sin(\alpha) & cos(\theta)*a \\
sin(\theta) &  cos(\theta)*cos(\alpha) & -cos(\theta)*sin(\alpha) & sin(\theta)*a \\

\end{matrix} \right]$
This is the transform matrix from the i-th link to the (i+1)-th link. Thus, I can invert it to obtain the transform matrix from the (i+1)-th link to the i-th link, but the problem is that this is not working. I believe that the reason is related to the fact that the DH convention doesn't work any more as it is.

1089,How to perform this reference system transformation?,"I have two quaternions that indicate the initial orientation of a four wheel robot, each one in relative to one reference systems. 
The robot's orientation given by a quaternion q is not the same in the two reference systems: For one reference system the quaternion q1 might refer to the robot looking at positive x while the same quaternion components q1 in the second reference system might refer to the robot looking at the negative x.
I have two matrices which indicate the position of the robot in time in its correspondent reference system.
I want to find the correspondent points of the first matrix in to the second reference system. Each matrix is built with a different sensor, so the results will be similar but not exactly the same.
I think I should find the transformation from the first reference system to the second and then apply it for each point of the first matrix. How can I find this transformation? The translation part I think is clear, but the rotation not at all.
Edit:
@WildCrustacean
The solution proposed does not solve the problem, I think that the reason is because each system represents the robot in a different way. 
In the initial one (A) the robot moving forward with no rotation would increase in the X axis. In the goal referential system (B) the robot moving forward with no rotation would increase in the Z axis. (See figure for more details) 

I think I have to apply an extra rotation to change the initial quaternion that belongs to the first system to be in accordance with the second system before applying the transformation of your post.
One rotation of 180 degrees around x followed by one of 90 around y. Would rotate from A to B 
This is how I tried to solve it:
# Quaternion to adjust reference system
first_quat = make_quaternion(unitary_x, pi) # Generates the quaternion that rotates pi around X 
second_quat = make_quaternion(unitary_y, pi/2.0) # Generates the quaternion that rotates pi/2 around Y 
composed_fs_q = first_quat*second_quat 

# Quaternion to rotate from one reference system to the other
quaternion_ini_A = quaternion_ini_A*composed_fs_q
A2B_quaternion = quaternion_ini_B*(quaternion_ini_A.inverse())

A2B_quaternion is the quaternion that I use for the rotation but still doesn't perform the right rotation. Any idea?

1117,How to obtain stereo correspondences and what exactly is a disparity map?,"I am currently reading into the topic of stereo vision, using the book of Hartley&Zimmerman alongside some papers, as I am trying to develop an algorithm capable of creating elevation maps from two images.
I am trying to come up with the basic steps for such an algorithm. This is what I think I have to do:
If I have two images I somehow have to find the fundamental matrix, F, in order to find the actual elevation values at all points from triangulation later on. If the cameras are calibrated this is straightforward if not it is slightly more complex (plenty of methods for this can be found in H&Z).
It is necessary to know F in order to obtain the epipolar lines. These are lines that are used in order to find image point x in the first image back in the second image.
Now comes the part were it gets a bit confusing for me: Now I would start taking a image point x_i in the first picture and try to find the corresponding point x_i in the second picture, using some matching algorithm. Using triangulation it is now possible to compute the real world point X and from that its elevation. This process will be repeated for every pixel in the right image.
In the perfect world (no noise etc) triangulation will be done based on

In the real world it is necessary to find a best fit instead.
Doing this for all pixels will lead to the complete elevation map as desired, some pixels will however be impossible to match and therefore can't be triangulated.
What confuses me most is that I have the feeling that Hartley&Zimmerman skip the entire discussion on how to obtain your point correspondences (matching?) and that the papers I read in addition to the book talk a lot about disparity maps which arent mentioned in H&Z at all. However I think I understood correctly that the disparity is simply the difference x1_i- x2_i?
Is this approach correct, and if not where did I make mistakes?

1120,Has a robot ever taken a complete IQ test?,"And if so, what was the highest score so far?
Some news articles suggest only parts of tests were aced.

Update since people censored this question and closed it. There was an AI that has taken an IQ test and scored similar to a 4 year old.


The AI system which they used is ConceptNet, an open-source project run by the MIT Common Sense Computing Initiative.
  Results: It scored a WPPSI-III VIQ that is average for a four-year-old child, but below average for 5 to 7 year-olds

Abstract

We administered the Verbal IQ (VIQ) part of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III) to the ConceptNet 4 AI system. The test questions (e.g., ""Why do we shake hands?"") were translated into ConceptNet 4 inputs using a combination of the simple natural language processing tools that come with ConceptNet together with short Python programs that we wrote. The question answering used a version of ConceptNet based on spectral methods. The ConceptNet system scored a WPPSI-III VIQ that is average for a four-year-old child, but below average for 5 to 7 year-olds. Large variations among subtests indicate potential areas of improvement. In particular, results were strongest for the Vocabulary and Similarities subtests, intermediate for the Information subtest, and lowest for the Comprehension and Word Reasoning subtests. Comprehension is the subtest most strongly associated with common sense. The large variations among subtests and ordinary common sense strongly suggest that the WPPSI-III VIQ results do not show that ""ConceptNet has the verbal abilities a four-year-old."" Rather, children's IQ tests offer one objective metric for the evaluation and comparison of AI systems. Also, this work continues previous research on Psychometric AI. 


Update. A robot has passed the Japanese college entrance test and has an 80% chance of being accepted. Since it scored more than the average, that would make the IQ > 100, especially since college applicants have an IQ greater than average, and especially since Japanese are smarter than average humans. 

The Wall Street Journal reports that the program, developed by Japans National Institute of Informatics, took a multi-subject college entrance exam and passed with an above-average score of 511 points out of a possible 950. (The national average is 416.) With scores like that, it has an 8 out of 10 chance of being admitted to 441 private institutions in Japan, and 33 national ones.

I ripped everything apart (the dust buster was broken) and the motor still works. After playing around with it for a while and letting it lying around for about two weeks it suddenly revs a lot slower. I supposed the battery pack was drained so I hooked up the battery pack to the charger and let it charge for a night. Unfortunately the motor still turns very slow.
Since I want to use this motor for my first home robotics project (making a kite fly with my computer), off I went to the local electronics store where they measured the charger to give 16V (even though it says 21V) and the battery pack to give about 5V. I then hooked up the motor directly to the charger, but unfortunately it doesn't even move an inch then.
So now I wonder:

Why doesn't the motor spin at all when hooking it up to the charger? (Could that be because the 250mA is too low?)

1158,Equation to limit rate of change of end-effector in X and Y coordinates,"Some vector math is involved here so prepare yourself.
I am developing a robotic arm that moves in two dimensions.  It is a rotary-rotary design which looks roughly like the picture in this post:
Building Robotic arm joint
I am now trying to limit the speed of the end-effector.  I am using Simulink and believe that the best way to limit the speed is the limit the rate of change of the X and Y coordinates that I tell it to move to.  
Now, I also want the end-effector to be able to move in a straight line and believe that I can accomplish this by defining functions that calculate the maximum rate for movement in the X or Y direction based on the distance the arm is trying to travel.  The equasion I came up with is this :

So basically, XRate: distance in x / max between distance in X and distance in Y.

Now, for the actual problem.  Because this limits the speed in both X and Y, the end-effector can travel (for instance) 1 in./sec in both directions at the same time.  Meaning that it is travelling at OVER 1 in./sec overall.  If, however, it is only moving in ONE direction then it will only move at that 1 in./sec speed because there is no second component.  It boils down to the fact that the max speed the arm can move is 'sqrt(2)' and the minimum is '1'.
My main question is:  Given that I need to calculate a max xRate and a max yRate, how can I limit the overall speed of the end-effector?
Secondarily, is there a way for me to implement a rate control that will limit the overall rate instead of limiting X and Y independantly using Simulink?

Having object lists, how can I determine whether some objects observed by different sensors are in fact the same object?

From literature I read those 4 steps:

Plot to track association (first update tracks estimates and then associate by ""acceptance gate"" or by statistical approach PDAF or JPDAF)
Track smoothing (lots of algorithms for generating new improved estimate, e.g.: EKF, UKF, PF)
Track initiation (create new tracks from unassociated plots)
Track maintenance (delete a track if was not associated for last M turns. also: predict those tracks that were associated, their new location based on previous heading and speed)

So basically I am questioning point 1, acceptance gate. For a single sensor I can imagine it can be just a comparison of xy position of object and sensor measurement, velocity with heading eventually. My case is however, I have already ready object lists from each sensor in every cycle, there are some algorithms how to merge informations about an object collected by different sensors (great source is e.g. here: ), but question is how to decide which objects should be fused, and which left as they were?

The question is, how to ensure all rocks are turned the right way when they get to the straw. Im not sure if using Lego when building the robot is off topic here, but a solution involving lego is preferable. And it has to be controlled by an Arduino.

1219,Drone targeting,"Imagine a ""drone"" and a target point on a 2d plane. Assuming the target is stationary, there are eight parameters:

The drone's job is to get to the target as fast as possible, obeying max torque and max thrust. There are only two ways to apply the torque, since this is only in a 2d plane. Thrust is restricted to only go in one direction relative to the orientation of the craft, and cannot be aimed without rotating the drone. Neglect any resistance, you can just pretend it is floating around in 2d outer space. Let's say the drone checks an equation at time interval t (maybe something like every .01 seconds), plugs in the parameters, and adjusts its torque and thrust accordingly.

What should the equations for thrust and torque be?

What have we tried?
We know that the time it takes for the drone to reach the target in the x-direction has to be the same for the same time in the y-direction. There is going to have to be some integral over time in each dimension to account for the changing thrust based on total thrust, and total thrust in each direction given the changing angular position. I have no idea how to tie the torque and thrust together in a practical way where a function can just be called to give what thrust and torque should be applied over the interval t unless there is some other technique.

1221,Quadrotor control using ArduIMU,"We are using ArduIMU (V3) as our Quadrotor's inertial measurement unit. (we have a separate board to control all motors, not with ArduIMU itself). 
As mentioned here , the output rate of this module is only at about 8hz. 
Isn't it super slow to control a quadrotor ? I'm asking because as mentioned in this answer a quadrotor needs at least 200hz of control frequency to easily stay in one spot, and our ESCs is configured to work with 450hz of refresh rate. Any working PID controller I saw before for Quadrotors used at least 200-400hz of control frequency.
I asked similar question before from Ahmad Byagowi (one of the developers of ArduIMU ) and he answered:

The arduimu calculates the dcm matrices and that makes it so slow. If
  you disable the dcm output, you can get up to 100 hz gyro, acc and so
  on.

So, what will happen if I disable DCM from the firmware ? Is it really important ? We did a simulation before and our PID controller works pretty well without DCM.

1266,What reward function results in optimal learning?,"Let's think of the following situations:

You are teaching a robot to play ping pong
You are teaching a program to calculate square root
You are teaching math to a kid in school

These situations (i.e. supervised learning), and many others have one thing (among others) in common: the learner gets a reward based on its performance.
My question is, what should the reward function look like? Is there a ""best"" answer, or does it depend on the situation? If it depends on the situation, how does one determine which reward function to pick?
For example, take the following three reward functions:


Function  says:

below a certain point, bad or worse are the same: you get nothing
there is a clear difference between almost good and perfect

Function B says:

you get reward linearly proportional to your performance

Function C says:

if your performance is bad, it's ok, you did your best: you still get some reward
there is not much difference between perfect and almost good


Intuitively, I'd think A would make the robot very focused and learn the exact pattern, but become stupid when dealing with similar patterns, while C would make it more adaptable to change at the cost of losing perfection.
One might also think of more complex functions, just to show but few:

So, how does one know which function to pick? Is it known which behavior would emerge from (at least) the basic A, B and C functions?

A side question is would this be fundamentally different for robots and human kids?

1270,How to detect when a stepper motor has stalled?,"How can I detect when a stepper motor has stalled?
A google search led me to some people who say that
when the stepper motor stalls, the current spikes up,
which is easily detectable with a Hall sensor.
(Or, I suppose, by any of the other current sensors mentioned at
""How can I sense the motor's current?""
).
However, I measured the current through (one of the 4 wires of) my stepper motor,
and it's always within a few percent of 0.5 A, whether my stepper driver is holding one position, moving it normally (which in my application is very slowly), or the stepper driver thinks it is telling the stepper to move normally, but the motor has pegged out against the hard limit.
Measuring the current in the +12V power supply going to the stepper motor driver, also seemed to give a fairly constant current.
This may be because I turned down the current limit to that amount on my ""chopper"" stepper motor driver.
Am I missing some key detail in the ""measure the current"" approach?
A google search led me to some other people that measure the back-EMF (BEMF) in one coil of the stepper during the time the stepper driver is only driving the other coil.
But that only seems to distinguish between ""a motor moving quickly"" vs ""a motor stopped"", and doesn't seem to distinguish between my case of ""a motor moving slowly"" vs ""a motor stopped"".
Is there some way to apply the BEMF approach even in a system where I always drive the stepper slowly, and never spin it quickly?
I'm currently using a stepper driver board with the TI DRV8825 chip on it, and I hoped the ""fault"" pin would tell me when the stepper motor has stalled against my hard stop.
But it doesn't seem to be doing anything -- is it supposed to tell me about a stall, but I just have it wired up wrong?
Is there some other chip or drive technique that detects when the stepper has stalled out against the hard stop?
Is there some other technique for detecting a hard stall that I can ""add on"" to a system using an off-the-shelf stepper motor driver?
(Is there some other StackExchange site that is more appropriate for questions about motors and motor drivers?)

1276,How can a load be balanced between multiple AC electric drive motors?,"I have a three wheeled vehicle in a tricycle configuration attached to a fixed frame. Each wheel is powered by an AC electric motor. The AC motors are fed by motor controllers that take a speed demand. The single main wheel (which is also steerable) has a lower gear ratio than the rear wheels so it has a theoretical higher top speed. 
When the vehicle drives in a straight line each of the motor controllers are given identical speed requests. Unfortunately feedback from the controller indicates that some motors are pushing while some are pulling. In particular we have a common scenario where one rear wheel is pushing while the front wheel is trying to slow down. The third wheel will often have almost no current. 
What can be done to make all three motors work together and avoid situations where they fight?  Is there a way to change the request to the motor controller to encourage the drives to work together? Do we have to switch from a speed request setup to a current control setup? If so what is the appropriate way to control the motors then?

1314,Visualizing and debugging an EKF,"I am currently debugging and tuning an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter). The task is classical mobile robot pose tracking where landmarks are AR markers.
Sometimes I am surprised how some measurement affects the estimate. When I look at and calculate the numbers and matrices involved, I can work out how the update step got executed, what and why exactly happened, but this is very tedious. 
So I wonder if anyone is using some technique, trick or clever visualization to get a better feel of what is happening in the EKF update step?
UPDATE #1 (will be more specific and show first approximation of what I have in mind)
What I am looking for, is some way to visualize one update step in a way that gives me a feel of how each component of the measurement affects each component of the state.
My very first idea is to plot the measurement and it's prediction together with some vectors taken from the K matrix. The vectors from K represent how the innovation vector (measurement - measurement prediction, not plotted) will affect each component of the state.
Currently I am working with an EKF where the state is 2D pose (x,y,angle) and the measurements are also 2D poses.

In the attached image(open it in new page/tab to see in full resolution), the (scaled) vector K(1,1:2) (MATLAB syntax to take a submatrix from 3x3 matrix) should give an idea how the first component of the EKF state will change with the current innovation vector, K(2,1:2) how the second component of EKF will change, etc. In this example, the innovation vector has a relatively large x component and it is aligned with vector K(2,1:2) - the second component of the state (y coordinate) will change the most.
One problem in this plot is that it does not give a feel of how the third component(angle) of the innovation vector affects the state. The first component of the state increases a bit, contrary to what K(1:1:2) indicates - the third component of the innovation causes this, but currently I can not visualize this.
First improvement would be to visualize how the third component of the innovation affects the state. Then it would be nice to add covariance data to get a feel how the K matrix is created.
UPDATE #2 Now the plot has vectors in state-space that show how each component of measurement changes the position. From this plot, I can see that the third component of the measurement changes the state most.

What I'd like to be able to do is add an additional two AA batteries behind the receiver to run the receiver system at 6V but add another two 3V 123A batteries to have the motor at 12V with the ability to run with the higher current draw due to the heavier load the motor will handle on its fancy new chassis... but without pulling that current through the receiver circuit.
My first thought is to simply connect my 123As negative to the motor and positive to a common ground... but I'm really not sure and I want to be careful to not damage the circuit or batteries.

perhaps some sort of autonomic driving? The car is built for offroad and the suspension is not too bad but it is pretty fast (40 km/h) so a crash would be fatal.
FPV (first person view) driving? I could add another servo to move a small camera.
""swarm intelligence""? I have built two of those vehicles. Both feature the arduino nano, a zigbee and LED front lights.
steering correction? I could integrate a gyro sensor to check if the car is not driving straight when it should.
telemetry to another arduino? I could build some sort of arduino-zigbee-handheld that shows me some information for both cars like motor temperature, current speed, uptime, battery voltage, sensor values etc.

Any ideas, anyone? Right now it is just driving like it normally would. I integrated an arduino into an RC toy that does an awesome amount of NOTHING. Makes me feel pretty stupid.

1348,Single camera vision and mapping system,"Some time ago I saw a demo of a small 'toy tank' with a single camera mounted on it. This tank was able to drive around the floor and detect objects and then move/steer to avoid them.
The interesting part was that it used a single camera vision system and as far as I remember was taking advantage of the floor being flat. and then using the rate a feature was moving in the scene relative to the motors and directions of travel to evaluate and hence map the scene.
Can anyone send me pointers what to search for to get some more information on this, or some pointers to codebases that can do this.
The reason I ask is that this was a single camera system from a number of years ago (5+) and therefore (from what I remember) was a relatively low compute load.

1349,Working of Autonomous Lawn mower(ALM) in an unbounded area without a perimeter wire,"I have an Autonomous Lawn mower(ALM) which can mow a certain lawn area when that area is bounded by a perimeter wire. Even when that perimeter wire is removed, it has to mow the above mentioned area accurately without slipping into a neighboring area.
Constraints and problems:

The ALM is an open loop system.
Differential GPS was tried, but it did not yield proper results.
Any iterative pattern of area coverage can be used provided the error in each iteration is not added cumulatively which can result in unpredictable error in the end.

I do not expect full fledged solution. But I need a starting point to understand motion planning particularly for unbounded robotics to solve this problem. 
I searched on internet to know about the knowledge sources about motion planning but could not get good results. Can anyone guide me to know about such sources preferably books and articles on internet which can help me to solve this problem?
EDIT:
Addition of information:
 
The above picture shows the irregular lawn area which does not have any enclosures and perimeter
wire
1.The red mark shows the center point of lawn .
2.The grey area is the initial scaled down area which resembles in shape to the larger area .I could not draw the grey area which exactly resembles the larger green area .
3.The grey lines are the contours which from the tracks to be followed by the lawn mower
Idea description:
1.Using planimeter app for onetime , the shape and dimension of the lawn area (green area) can be known
Link:
2.Center of polygon can be found by using the method in the following link

3.Calculation of area of grey shape in the above figure .
4 . Grey shape is the least possible area which can be grazed by the ALM . Grey shape is similar to the green area shape and it is formed when Green area is scaled down
To determine the scale down factor which is a numerical value  n (n<1) 
Where Grey area = n * Green area
Once the Grey area is known , the number of contours or tracks to be grazed by ALM have to be determined manually .
The width of contour is equal to the distance between the blades on the either end i.e. the width which can be grazed by ALM in a single stroke .
Green area = Grey area + area of track 1 + area of track 2 + area of track3 + . . . . . . + area of track n
5.Once the lawn mower is switched on ,it should reach the center of the lawn (red mark showed in the above figure)
6.Then, ALM should graze the least possible area or grey area .
7.After that ALM should Switch to contour circumscribing the grey area . It should continue circumscribing in each track till all the tracks are completed( decision has to be made by validating against the calculated and preset value ' No.of tracks' in ALM)   
In this way entire lawn can be mowed without the need of perimeter wire and also ALM would not mow the neighbors lawn 
Challenges :
a. Enable ALM to reach the center point of the lawn
a. To make ALM mow the grey area accurately
b. To make the ALM switch from one track to track .
c. To bypass the obstacle in track and return to the same track .
When i mentioned this idea to my colleague ,he mentioned the about possible cumulative addition of error in each iteration resulting in an unpredictable error in the end .
I intend to minimize the error and fix the boundary as correct as possible. 
In fact this deviation should be predictable before it can be corrected .

I understand that sensors which can quantitatively detect these compounds development are being developed. My idea is to build a swarm of robots which can spray pesticides by detecting VOCs on three targets present on plants across the fields.

Target 1: Visible worms, pests, larvae. May these can be mechanically eliminated 
Target 2: Invisible pathogens on certain areas of a plant 
Target 3: Areas where pesticides have to be sprayed to prevent disease 

For these targets, pesticide has to be administered in the correct concentration

Ideally, I'd like to use an inexpensive sensor or combination of sensors to detect a person within a room and localize that person. I would like the robot to enter a room, detect if a human(s) is/are present and then move to the detected human. The accuracy does not need to be 100%, as cost is more of a factor. I'd like the computational requirements of such a sensor to be such that it can run on an Arduino, although if it's impossible, I'd be willing to utilize something with more horespower, such as a Raspberry Pi or a BeagleBone Black. I have a few thoughts; however, none of them are ideal:

PIR Sensor - Can detect movement within a large field of vision (ie. usually 120 degrees or more).  Might be the closest thing to a ""human"" detector that I'm aware of; however, it requires movement and localizing/triangulating where a person is would be very difficult (impossible?) with such a large field of vision.
Ultrasound - Can detect objects with good precision.  Has a much narrower field of view; however, is unable to differentiate between a static non-living object and a human.
IR detectors - (ie. Sharp range sensors) Can again detect objects with great precision, very narrow field of view; however, it is again unable to differentiate objects.
Webcam + OpenCV - Possibly use face detection to detect human(s) in a room.  This may be the best option; however, OpenCV is computationally expensive and would require much more than an arduino to run.  Even on a Raspberry Pi, it can be slow.
Kinect - Using the feature detection capabilities of Kinect, it would be relatively easy to identify humans in an area; however, the Kinect is too expensive and I would not consider it a ""cheap"" solution.

Set 1: Time based control
In this code set, I set the tripod motor set to move at their rated rpm for a required amount of time before shifting to the other tripod motor set.
PID control would be based on counting the number of transitions using an optical speed encoder, Calculating the error based on difference between actual speed and required speed and then adjusting the error with fixed Kd and Ki values.
Set 2: Transitions based control
In this code set I count to the number of transitions required to complete one rotation of the leg(tripod motor set) before starting the other leg(tripod motor set).
PID control would be time based. Calculation of error would be the difference in time taken for individual motors of the motor set.
Query:
The set 2 shows promising results even without PID control, but the first set does not.Why so? The motors are basically set to move 1 rotation before the other set moves.

I am in the process of building a mobile autonomous robot which must navigate around an unknown area, must avoid obstacles and receive speech input to do various tasks. It also must recognize faces, objects etc. I am using a Kinect Sensor and wheel odometry data as its sensors. I chose C# as my primary language as the official drivers and sdk are readily available. I have completed the Vision and NLP module and am working on the Navigation part. 
My robot currently uses the Arduino as a module for communication and a Intel i7 x64 bit processor on a laptop as a CPU.
This is the overview of the robot and its electronics: 



The Problem
I implemented a simple SLAM algorithm which gets robot position from the encoders and the adds whatever it sees using the kinect (as a 2D slice of the 3D point cloud) to the map.
This is what the maps of my room currently look like:
 
This is a rough representation of my actual room:

As you can see, they are very different and so really bad maps.

Is this expected from using just dead reckoning?
I am aware of particle filters that refine it and am ready to implement, but what are the ways in which I can improve this result? 


Update 
I forgot to mention my current approach (which I earlier had to but forgot). My program roughly does this: (I am using a hashtable to store the dynamic map)


Grab point cloud from Kinect
Wait for incoming serial odometry data
Synchronize using a time-stamp based method
Estimate robot pose (x,y,theta) using equations at Wikipedia and encoder data
Obtain a ""slice"" of the point cloud
My slice is basically an array of the X and Z parameters
Then plot these points based on the robot pose and the X and Z params

1455,Help with adaptive fill algorithm for Water Color Painting Robot,"TL;DR:
Can anyone point me to a good adaptive path fill algorithm?
Hey there, my name is James, and my daughter built an awesome painting robot with her friends over at Evil Mad Scientist labs, even brought it to the white house, very fun stuff!
Anyways, I'm a web programmer by day, and though it might be fun to try and write some software to get the robot to do some cool stuff, and for some crazy reason I decided to do this using standard web technologies like SVG and JavaScript, and.. it actually works! [see the project at ]
But there's a problem: to fill in colors for given shapes, it requires some kind of path filling algorithm using a given size shape to cover every part of the shape internally, not to mention it has to take into account overlapping paths and occlusions.
I have successfully created ""fake"" fills, by following known paths like spirals and back and forth hatch lines over paths, while detecting occlusion using browser internal functions for detecting what object lies at a given x/y coordinate, but these fill functions fall incredibly short of doing anything other than simply following paths, and can be incredibly inefficient at filling certain paths (like filling borders, letters, or U shaped areas).
The question: I need an adaptive path filling algorithm. I know they're currently being used in similar CNC setups for milling, and similar algorithms are used by the Roomba and 3D printers to figure out coverage in the most efficient way possible. The issue comes in that I don't think any have ever been done in JavaScript, using native SVG paths.
Anyone out there know where I should look? I'm not too afraid to attempt to port something over to JS, or possibly even use it as is for a native Node.JS module. All my work will be sure to go back to the community and become open source as well.
Thanks for the help!

How do I build a machine to pull liquid from a reservoir and fills a bottle using a piston, with electronic parts such as stepper motor, linear actuators and sensors?
I understand this is somewhat vague. Any aligned response is appreciated.
Update:
This machine should, at its max speed, fill a 1 litter bottle with water in 2 seconds (to deliver 30 bottles per minute). Higher viscosity liquids may take longer.
It should not spill so liquid needs some filling acceleration control.
You may assume two operation modes: with bubbles and without bubbles. The first is a plus.
I'd like to be able to change the volume electronically (via a LCD menu).
I thought of a single main valve that switches between the reservoir and the bottle. That should be controlled electronically too. I could use two valves too.

1552,Use of automated tricopters instead of quadcopters?,"Hy, I just found useful to post my idea here. 
I've seen videos about automated quadcopters:  and . 
I surfed pages from the companies presenting this research and other information on the internet, but I haven't found why they use quadcopters specifically. 
I understand, how accelerating, rotating and rolling works in those quadcopters - it's simple, but they claim that quadcopters have minimum number of working parts to fulfill their needs, which I don't agree and I think that tricopters are better in this (duocopters can't rotate horizontally, but tricopters can by inclining and then powering the remaining left or right propeller). 
I rode forums, calculated and draw drafts of both tri and quad and found, that tri is much more efficient just in everything than quad with same props and battery when taken in account that best properties has the smallest copter with the largest props so: 
3:4 moving parts (no vectored yaw in tri), 9.5:16 size, building Y instead of X construction take far less material 1.5:2.82, lesser maximum power input 3:4, better power efficiency makes longer flight time and tricopters have also improved agility over quadcopters. 
The only disadvantage I see is a bit complicated horizontal rotating in tricopter without vectored yaw, which can be problem in man controlled machines but easily solved by simple algorithms in automated machines -> it's not a real disadvantage, just a small work to be done. I was thinking about doing that in my bachelor thesis, but for now I am looking for your opinions, thanks!
EDIT: Maybe the torque is the problem, because on tricopters you can can have all 3 props in 1 direction or 2 in 1 direction and 1 in the opposite and it's symmetrical in neither way, but I'm not sure if this is the main problem...

GPS antena on quadcopter
Radio to transmit coordinates from moving object to quad copter

Line of sight for camera. How does the camera know exactly where to point?
Angle, how can I pre-program the quad to always record, say... 10m to the right of the moving object, or even better, program a set of angles to record from whilst keeping up with the object
GPS accuracy, what happens if the GPS lock is weak?

What are some of my other options? I saw this TED Talk where the quads are following a ball shaped sensor? I believe it uses Kinect cameras and lots of them which is not really an option for this challenge.
So I'm open to hearing some ideas before I start research and development of these features.

1562,If you can create pure yaw motion with a quadcoptor then why won't this work with a tricoptor?,"An answer to the question Why do quadcopters have four propellers? (Besides the name)  said:

You need 4 degrees of freedom to control yaw, pitch, roll and thrust.
Four props is therefore the minimum number of actuators required. Tricoptors require a servo to tilt one or more rotors which is more mechanically complicated.

In a comment, I asked:

How do you get pure yaw motion with a quadcoptor and if that's possible why won't this work with a tricoptor? I don't understand how can you get yaw motion with any system where all rotors are in a plane without first tilting and moving. I would have thought that the main difference between quadcopters and tricoptors would be the kinematic calculations would be more complex.

Another answer explained:

you get pure yaw in the following way:
North and South motors rotating the same speed but collectively at a higher (or lower) speed than East and West Motors which are also at the same speed. 

This explains why it works with a quadcopter, but doesn't explain why it won't work with a tricopter.
Is it simply the fact that the asymmetry means that you can't imbalance the torque effects to provide yaw movement while still keeping the thrusts balanced to keep pitch and roll constant?

The sonar sensors themselves are pretty good. We use a low-pass filter to deal with noise, and the readings seem pretty accurate.

The plot below was made when the robot was facing a wall. See the curve in the blue lines, as compared to the straight red line. The red line was produced by using a camera to detect the wall, where the blue lines show filtered sonar readings. 

We believe this error is due to crosstalk, where one sonar sensor's pulse bounces off the wall at an angle and is received by another sensor. This is a systematic error, so we can't really deal with it like we would with noise. Are there any solutions out there to correct for it?

How do you condition that computation to avoid situations of dividing by zero, obtaining , or Inf? Also, if $p(Ex_{in})_{new}$ is almost 1, then $\alpha$ will be huge, increasing output, and increasing it enormously in each later cycle, so that the object will live forever. How to prevent it?

1603,How to implement the Wavefront algorithm,"I am thinking of creating a robot that can navigate using a map. It is controlled from a PC. An 8-bit controller performs low level tasks and the PC is doing the image processing. I plan to implement it in a single room where the robot is placed and the robot and environment are tracked by a camera from a height or from the ceiling of the room. First, the robot needs to be mapped, like this 
To do:

Track the robot from some height  using camera Following the
wavefont algorithim to locate robot and obstacles.

Procedure:(just my idea)
The camera will give image of the robot surrounded by obstacles in the random places.
 using some opencv technique draw some grind over the image. 

Locating the  grid which contain  robot(by having some colored
symbol over the robot) and locating the grids containing the 
obstacle.
Now the grids with obstacle is thought as wall and the remaining is
the free space for the robot to navigate.
robot is going to get  the goal place which should be reached is
given from the pc(may be like point the place to reach in the image
by mouse click).

Unknowns :

Mapping the room and locating the robot

How  to do that? The robot should know where it is in the map or the image. We cannot believe only the camera is enough to locate the robot. So I thought of adding triangulation mapping like placing two IRs in the room and a receiver in the robot.
The doubt I have in this is how an IR receiver can know from which direction it is receiving the IR signal (from left or right ). I think it knows only that it receives IR not the direction. Then how is the triangulation going to happen if I don't know the angle and direction?

coming to the image processing, how can I implement the Wavefront
   algorithm(that is capture the live vedio and draw grids over it to
   find robot and the obstacles)?

I have HC-05 Bluetooth module, Arduino, Bluetooth dongle, chassis with dc motors and driver, and a dc supply.

1614,ArduIMU noisy output in Quadrotor,"We are using ArduIMU (V3) as our Quadrotor's inertial measurement unit. (we have a separate board to control all motors, not with ArduIMU itself). 
Now we have a problem with ArduIMU's sensors output. When we put our quadrotor steady on the ground with motors on, instead of getting 0 degree in roll and pitch we have a noisy output something like the image below( -6 to 6 degree error ):

delta_t = 0.2s
We are sure that this isn't a mechanical problem, because we checked the mechanical joints and everything.
I should mention that with motors off everything is going well. Also we checked that if we vibrate the device slowly on yaw axis or any other axis, it still shows the noisy output.
We are using DCM filter inside ArduIMU, also we tested with Kalman filter but no difference.
We also tested FRI low-pass filter, results is good but there is about 3 seconds delay in the output.
We also checked that if we separate the ArduImu's power from our circuit, it still no difference.
What's the problem with ArduIMU and how we can get rid off this noisy output ?
Update: 
We think that the problem with our PID controller is because of these noises ... Is this a true assumption ? We can't tune our PID parameters ( using ZieglerNichols method ) when we have noisy data. We tested ZieglerNichols method when we have low rate noises and we successfully tuned our PID but when noise appears we are unable to tune PIDs. Is there anyway for us for tuning our PID in such situation ? Is this problem is because of the noises or the PID itself can get rid of them ?

1627,Why do quadcopters use brushless motors,"I've been thinking about starting a quadcopter project, maybe building it from scratch. One of the main barriers-to-entry for me is the motors: it seems like most quadcopters use brushless motors. I have some experience with DC motors and using PWM signals to regulate speed, but no experience with brushless motors. As I understand it, brushless motors are more expensive than the typical DC motor I would use on a land robot, and they also require electronic speed controllers (ESCs), which seem to make them (from my perspective) even more expensive and more complicated to use.
So, my question: what is it about brushless motors that make them useful in a quadcopter? Is it more torque, less weight, something to do with efficiency? And would it be significantly harder (or even possible) to achieve lift using DC motors instead?

A ball drops through a hole onto the conveyer belt hitting a lever switch on its way through. This switch triggers the motor to start. When the ball gets to the top of the belt and falls off it hits another lever switch that turns the motor off.
I could handle this logic by hooking it up to my raspberry pi and using python to start and stop the motor depending on which GPIO pin received input (top or bottom lever). Or I could use a single lever and set a constant time interval to stop the motor. I would prefer to use both to handle any change in scale/construction.

1638,WHY are there no operating torque specifications on steppers?,"I have been looking online for a while, and I cannot seem to find any steppers without any torque ratings. (Operating torque, not holding torque.) I even looked on hobby sites that usually have all the ratings, including Adafruit and Sparkfun. I only have found one ever that said the operating torque, however, it didn't seem that reputable and it didn't have holding torque, so it might be likely that it's a mistake. I might contact them and ask.
Am I missing something? Can I calculate what it will run at with certain factors? (How long in between each step, etc.)
The reason that I say that is I found a tutorial saying how much torque (didn't specify which kind, but I kinda assume it isn't holding) you need for a CNC machine (what I'm building).

Equation (From this site):

Also on the page:

By the way, we are talking about torque during a continual turning motion, not at a holding position.

That seems like operating torque, but what makes it the most confusing is they sell steppers and they only list the holding.

1653,Calculate position of differential drive robot,"How do you calculate or update the position of a differential drive robot with incremental sensors?
There is one incremental sensor attatched to each of the two differential wheels. Both sensors determine the distance $\Delta left$ resp. $\Delta right$ their wheel has rolled during a known time $\Delta t$.
First, let's assume the center between both wheels marks the position of the robot. In this case, one could calculate the position as:
$$
x = \frac{x_{left}+x_{right}}{2} \\
y = \frac{y_{left}+y_{right}}{2}
$$
""Deriving"" those equations under the assumption that both wheels rolled in a straight line (which should be approximately correct for small distances) I get:
$$
\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\Delta left}{\Delta t} + \frac{\Delta right}{\Delta t}\right)cos(\theta) \\
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\Delta left}{\Delta t} + \frac{\Delta right}{\Delta t}\right)sin(\theta)
$$
Where $\theta$ is the angle of orientation of the robot. For the change of this angle I found the equation
$$
\frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{w} \left( \frac{\Delta left}{\Delta t} - \frac{\Delta right}{\Delta t}\right)
$$
Where $w$ is the distance between both wheels.
Because $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ depend on $\theta$, I wonder whether I should first calculate the new $\theta$ by adding $\Delta \theta$ or if I should rather use the ""old"" $\theta$ ? Is there any reason to use one over the other?
Then, let's now assume the center between both wheels does not mark the position of the robot. Instead I want to use a point which marks the geometric center of the robot's bounding box. Then $x$ and $y$ change to:
$$
x = \frac{x_{left}+x_{right}}{2} + l\, cos(\theta)\\
y = \frac{y_{left}+y_{right}}{2} + l\, sin(\theta)
$$
""Deriving"" the first gives:
$$
\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\Delta left}{\Delta t} + \frac{\Delta right}{\Delta t}\right)cos(\theta) - l\,sin(\theta)\,\frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
$$
Now there is a dependance on $\Delta \theta$. Is this a reason to use the ""new"" $\theta$ ?
Is there any better method to do simulatenous update of position and orientation? May be using complex numbers (same approach as with quaternions in 3D?) or homogeneous coordinates?

1678,Smooth servo movement for a crawling robot,"I made a small crawler robot a little while ago that had two legs with two degrees of freedom each, so 4 RC servos total. While I was programming the movement of the legs I noticed that they moved rather stiffly. It makes sense that the RC servo's internal controller would have a very quick response to position commands, but I wanted my crawler to move in a way that seems a little more smooth and life-like.
My solution was create a cubic function of time that describes the path of the servos, and then set their position in small time increments, resulting in more smooth motion. Essentially what I did was solve for the $a_i$ coefficients in a cubic equation using the time interval, starting and ending position of the servo, and starting and ending rates the servo should move (which is just the derivative of the position):
Solve for $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$:
$$ position(t) = a_0 + a_1t + a_2t^2 + a_3t^3 $$
$$ rate(t) = position'(t) = a_1 + 2a_2t + 3a_3t^2 $$
Given: $position(0)$, $position(t_f)$, $rate(0)$, $rate(t_f)$
I set the rate of the servo between a pair of movements to be zero if the movements were in opposite directions, and positive or negative if the movements were both in the positive or negative direction, respectively. 
This worked pretty well, but this solution is limited in a few ways. For one, it's difficult to decide what exactly the rates between movements that go in the same direction should be. I used the average of the slopes ahead and behind of a particular position between movements, but it isn't clear to me that is optimal. Second of all, cubic curves could take the servo to a position outside of the range of the positions at the beginning and end of a movement, which may be undesirable. For example, at some point during the time interval, the curve could cause the servo to go beyond the second position, or below the first position. Thirdly, curve generation here does not consider the maximum rate that the servo can turn, so a curve may have the servo move at a speed that is unrealistic. With that, a minor concern is that the maximum turning rate depends on the response of servo's internal controller, and may change depending on the size of the position interval. 
Neglecting that last concern, these issues may be solved by increasing the degree of the polynomial and adding constraints to solve for the coefficients, but I'm now starting to wonder...
Is there a better way than this to make servo movement smooth and seem more life-like?

Since the robot is required to make relatively sharp turns at high speed. Therefore I have two options to compensate the different speeds on both sides. On the one hand, a differential gear in the front axle could be used. It would be powered by one motor then. On the other hand, I could simply use two motors directly powering each a front wheel. This way I could simulate the differentiation in software.
I'd like to go for the first approach, using the hardware differential. But I have the one concern with it. Would a robot vehicle with differential gear still move straight, without explicit steering applied?
My imagination is that, with those wheels not being solidly connected, the robot would move in random curves which I'd have to compensate with a lot of steering then. I know that for real cars, differential gears are standard and do their work, but now I am talking about a small robot measuring about 6 inches.

Here's how I would do it: I would take the difference between the left and right encoders, bound the error between some range, normalize it to be from [-1, 1], and then map it to the motor powers 0 to 1. So if I and D were zero, and we get an error of 1 (so the left motor has turned much more than the right motor), then left motor would be set to 0, and the right motor set to 1 (causing a hard left). 
Are there any issues with this? What is a better approach?

1712,What is the difference between RC motors for cars and helicopters?,"I am working on a robot with focus on speed. At the moment I am looking for a suitable motor but it world help if I understood the difference between the various options.
To provide some background, I have not worked with RC model components before, but I think this is the only place for me to find the components needed for my robot, such as the motor.
I have already figured out how much power the motor needs to accelerate my robot as desired, taking energy conversion efficiency and tractional resistance into account. It's about 170 watts, depending on the final weight.
To limit my search further, I need to decide on either using a RC car motor or a RC helicopter motor now, but I don't understand the difference between these options.
Focussing on brushless motors (if that matters), what are the differences between RC car and RC helicopter motors which might need to be taken into account when choosing between them?

I am quite new on digital signal processing, and maybe some very fundamental explanations will help a lot.
Say I have a Complementary Filter as follows:
$$y =a\cdot y+(1-a)\cdot x$$
Then my parameter $a$ may be calculated by $$a=\frac{\text{time constant}}{\text{time constant}+\text{sample period}}$$
where the $\text{sample period}$ is simply the reciprocal of the $\text{sampling frequency}$.
The $\text{time constant}$ seems to be at my own choice.
My Questions:

What is the theory behind this calculation?
How do we choose the $\text{time constant}$ properly?

When a SLAM-equipped device detects an object, that object's position is stored. If you look at the point cloud the device is generating, you'll see points for this object, and models generated from it will include geometry here.
If an object is placed in a previously-empty space, it is detected, and points are added. Subsequent models will feature geometry describing this new object.
How does the device react if that object is removed? As far as I've seen, SLAM systems will tend to leave the points in place, resulting in ""ghost"" geometry. There are algorithms that will disregard lone points caused by transient contacts, but objects that remained long enough to build up a solid model will remain in the device's memory. Are there any systems that are capable of detecting that previously-occupied space is now empty?

1765,Place for GPS antenna on autonomous vehicle,"I used to think that the higher GPS antenna position the better until I read the following on GPSd FAQ:

One common error is to place the GPS or antenna as high as possible.
  This will increase multipath effects due to signal bounce from the
  ground or water, which can cause the GPS to mistake its position and
  the time signal. The correct location for a boat GPS antenna is on the
  gunwale rail or pushpit rail, close to the water and as far from the
  mast as possible (to reduce signal bounce from the mast). If you're
  outside or in a fixed location, put the GPS antenna as far from
  buildings as possible, and on the ground.
If you're in a car, don't
  put the GPS antenna on the roof, put it on the towbar or some similar
  location. If you're driving in a heavily built up area, you're going
  to get signal bounce off buildings and reduced accuracy. That's just
  how the physics works. Note, however, that as your velocity goes up it
  becomes easier for the convergence filters in your GPS to spot and
  discard delayed signal, so multipath effects are proportionally less
  important in fast-moving vehicles.

Does anyone has experience placing GPS antenna on a towbar of the car as suggested? Does it give reasonable effect?
My concern is that placing antenna there will not reduce an error that much, but will expose the device (antenna) to possible mechanical damage.
So, are there any better positions apart from roof and towbar?

1766,How to model unpredictable noise in Kalman Filter?,"Background:
I am implementing a simple Kalman Filter that estimates the heading direction of a robot. The robot is equipped with a compass and a gyroscope.
My Understanding:
I am thinking about representing my state as a 2D vector $(x, \dot{x})$, where $x$ is the current heading direction and  $\dot{x}$ is the rotation rate reported by the gyroscope.
Questions:

If my understanding is correct, there will be no control term, $u$ in my filter. Is it true? What if I take the state as a 1D vector $(x)$? Then does my $\dot{x}$becomes the control term $u$? Will these two methods yield different results?
As we know, the main noise source comes from the compass when the compass is in a distorted magnetic field. Here, I suppose the Gaussian noise is less significant. But the magnetic distortion is totally unpredictable. How do we model it in the Kalman Filter?
In Kalman Filter, is the assumption that ""all the noises are white"" necessary? Say, if my noise distribution is actually a Laplacian distribution, can I still use a Kalman Filter? Or I have to switch to another filter, like Extended Kalman Filter?

As can be seen, the $\theta$ can be easily time-updated.
But what about my $\omega$? The robot is not at my control. So its rotation rate at next moment is unpredictable.

I typically only use the chip to indicate the gravity vector.  So when using this chip, I simply negate the values to get a right handed coordinate system.  But this doesn't seem right.  I assume there is a logical and mathematical explanation for the left-handed coordinate system but i can't figure out what it might be.

MORSE was never meant to be a physically accurate simulator: while we rely on a state-of-the-art physics engine (Bullet), do not expect to accurately simulate robot arm dynamics or fine grasping. Other projects are doing that much better (like OpenGrasp for grasping).
While on-going efforts try to tackle this issue, we do not consider MORSE to have a good enough temporal accuracy and time synchronization capabilities for application like hybrid simulation (where some robots are simulated while others are physically operated).

1895,Arduino for simple Data-Glove. Should I go with Mega or Due?,"First, I'm a beginner in MCU/Robotic world (been working with ATMega+CVavr, but that's all). so please bear with me.
I'm making a prototype data glove (Like KeyGlove, but much more simpler), it consist of:

IMU sensors (MPU 9150 9DOF, all reading is fused with built in DMP) ->
Reads hand position and orientations
Minimum of 2 flex sensors -> Reads Figer flexion
MCU (well, Arduino to be specific)

The sensors are plugged in to the Arduino and the reading will be filtered (e.g Low pass, Kalmann) in the Arduino before being transferred over serial to PC. The PC will then translates the data into virtual gripper to move an object (VR)  
Initially I planned to use UNO +  Pansentis MPU9150 Library in my code, then I realised the flash memory size left would be so tiny (i.e MPU9150 lib code size is ~29k, Uno has 32k).
My project is still in very early stage, so a lot things are expected to be changed and added, with so little flash memory left. I can only do so much.  
I immediately looking for Mega as replacement (256k flash) but I realised there is also newer Due with faster processor. 
They cost effectively the same as for now.
.
My main concern here is the robustness and compatibility when:

Designing  the HW interface to Arduino (making circuits, addding
shield)
Code development (available library)
Streaming and filtering the sensor readings (would 32 bit MCus helps, or it's overkill?)

I know this question might sound as too localized, but I believe a lot of projects that utilize multiple sensor reading + filtering similarly will also benefits from this discussion.
I'll revise the question if it's needed. The main question is probably
Would 32 bit MCUs perform significantly better in multiple sensor reading and signal filtering compared to 8 bit MCUs?
Or in my case.. should I go with Mega or Due?

However, I come from an electrical/software background; not a mechanical one. So I need to figure out a decent way to shift gears. I was thinking of leaving the gear system in place as is and using some sort of motor (servo or stepper motor with worm gears) to pull and release the wire cable as needed. However, I have some concerns with this; namely the amount of torque needed to pull the wire and finding something with enough holding torque. Perhaps my best option is to use the trigger shifters on as well and perhaps use a solenoid. My other concern (namely with the worm gear) is that it'll be too slow.

My situation is this: my system begins at some unknown location, which I initialize the location (x y) and orientation (roll, pitch, and yaw) all to zero.

The body frame is fixed to my system, and travels with the system as it moves.
I have an estimation routine that provides me with the x and y position, as well as the roll, pitch, and yaw of the system. Yaw is rotation about the z axis of the local frame. Pitch and roll are with respect to the body frame (I.e.,if the robot pitches up, I always get a positive value. If it rolls right, I get a positive value.)

To my astonishment, the Internet doesn't seem to be saturated with such controllers (talk about reinventing the wheel - hundreds of tutorials but almost no pre-built solutions! Did Willow Garage build their own PID controller for the PR2?!). 
Does anyone have recommendations/experience, preferably pointers to such controllers? 
I've Googled around quite a bit, and so far this is the best option I've found. It's a cape for a BeagleBone Black (which is the board we're using). The problem is that the Python library is not finished - it resets PID constants at every call, it doesn't support changing the direction of the motor, and it seems to only support setting motor power, not velocity, which gives me the impression that it's not actually using the PID controller at all.
Additional details:

The stall current of our drive motors is 6A. They are brushless DC motors with quadrature encoders. The secondary motors are much smaller, and we're building our own encoders for them.
Our code base is in Python, and we're running on a BeagleBone Black using the latest Debian image from Robert Nelson (that guy's awesome!). Our batteries provide 14.8V, and we already have 3.3V and 5V rails.
Our robot is fairly small, about 1x1x2 feet, and weighs about 9 pounds. This info is meant to give perspective with regard to scale.

       612.92     &       0     &       0      &      0     &       0      &      0\\

You can easily see that the 4th row corresponding to $\dot{r_x}$ is all zeros, which is exactly the lost degree of freedom in this position.
However, other cases are not so straightforward.

$$
\mathbf{J} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
          -50   &   -324.52  &    -649.52   &         0   &   -86.603   &         0\\
       987.92   &         0  &          0   &         0   &         0   &         0\\
            0   &   -937.92  &       -375   &         0   &       -50   &         0\\
            0   &         0  &          0   &       0.5   &         0   &       0.5\\
            0   &         1  &          1   &         0   &         1   &         0\\
            1   &         0  &          0   &    -0.866   &         0   &    -0.866
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Here you can clearly see that joint 4 and joint 6 are aligned because the 4th and 6th columns are the same.  But it's not clear which Cartesian degree of freedom is lost (it should be a rotation about the end effector's x axis in red).
Even less straightforward are singularities at workspace limits.

$$
\mathbf{J} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
          -50     &     650   &       325  &          0    &        0     &       0\\
       1275.8     &       0   &         0  &         50    &        0     &       0\\
            0     & -1225.8   &   -662.92  &          0    &     -100     &       0\\
            0     &       0   &         0  &    0.86603    &        0     &       1\\
            0     &       1   &         1  &          0    &        1     &       0\\
            1     &       0   &         0  &        0.5    &        0     &       0
\end{bmatrix}
$$
In this case, the robot is able to rotate $\dot{-r_y}$ but not $\dot{+r_y}$.  There are no rows full of zeros, or equal columns, or any clear linearly dependent columns/rows.  
Is there a way to determine which degrees of freedom are lost by looking at the jacobian?
",robotic-arm inverse-kinematics industrial-robot
2000,Maintaining positive-definite property for covariance in an unscented Kalman filter update,"I have an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) that tracks the state of a robot. The state vector has 12 variables. Each time I carry out a prediction step, my transfer function (naturally) acts on the entire state. However, my sensors provide measurements of different parts of the robot's state, so I may get roll, pitch, yaw and their respective velocities in one measurement, and then linear velocity in another.
My approach to handling this so far has been to simply create sub-matrices for the covariance, carry out my standard UKF update equations, and then stick the resulting values back into the full covariance matrix. However, after a few updates, the UKF yells at me for trying to pass a matrix that isn't positive-definite into a Cholesky Decomposition function. Clearly the covariance is losing its positive-definite properties, and I'm guessing it has to do with my attempts to update subsets of the full covariance matrix. 
As an example taken from an actual log file, the following matrix (after the UKF prediction step) is positive-definite:

However, after processing the correction for one variable (in this case, linear X velocity), the matrix becomes:

As you can see, the only difference between the two is the value in the location of the variance of linear X velocity, which is the measurement I just processed. This difference is enough to ""break"" my covariance matrix.
I have two questions:

Updating a subset of the filter doesn't appear to be the right way to go about things. Is there a better solution?
Alternatively, am I missing a step that would keep my covariance matrix as positive-definite?

Thanks!
EDIT:
It looks like I'm not properly placing the values back into the original covariance matrix. Simply copying the values back isn't sufficient. I need to track the correlation coefficients for the covariance matrix, and make sure that when I update a variance value, I update all the values in its row/column to maintain the correlation coefficient value. I have to do some more testing to verify that this is my issue, but some initial analysis in Matlab suggests that it is. If I'm correct, I'll answer my own question.
EDIT 2:
Given the response below and after trying it, I can see that my original edit idea won't fly. However, I have one more question:
As this is a UKF, I don't actually have Jacobian matrices. I think I see how I would make it work within the UKF update equations, but even in an EKF - and I ask because I have one of those as well - my state-to-measurement function $h$ is going to end up being the identity matrix, as I am directly measuring my state variables. In the case, I take it my ""Jacobian"" would just be an $m \times n$ matrix with ones in the $(i, i)$ location, where $i$ is the index of the measured values in the measurement vector?

I am processing measurements in my EKF for a subset of the variables in my state. My state vector is of cardinality 12.

$x' = x + K(z - h(x_s))$
where $x_s$ is a vector containing only the parts of the full state vector that I am measuring.

Does it make sense that this vector, which I will add to the current state, has non-zero values in positions other that 1 and 2 (the x and y positions of my robot)? The other non-zero locations correspond to the robot's z location, and the x, y, and z velocities. It seems strange to me that a measurement of x and y should yield changes to other variables in the state vector. Am I incorrect in this assumption?
Incidentally, the covariance update works very well with the Jacobean in this form, and maintains its positive-definite property.

2011,How to calculate the right and left speed for a tank-like rover?,"I am trying to control the Rover 5 robot using an Android app with a touch-based joystick control in the app UI. I want to calculate the speed of the left and right motors in the rover when joystick is moved.
From the joystick, I get two values, pan and tilt. I convert them into the polar coordinate system with  and theta. Where r ranges from 0 to 100 and theta from 0 to 360. I want to derive an equation which can convert the (r, theta) to (left_speed, right_speed) for rover. The speed values also are in the [0;100] range.
Now, here is what I have figured out till now. For any value of r, 
If theta = 0 then left_speed = r, right_speed = -r (turning right on spot) 
If theta = 90 then left_speed = r, right_speed = r (moving forward at speed r) 
If theta = 180 then left_speed = -r, right_speed = r (turning left on spot) 
If theta = 270 then left_speed = -r, right_speed = -r (moving backwards at speed r) 
For other values, I want it moving and turning simultaneously. For example,
If theta = 45 then left_speed = alpha*r, right_speed = beta*r (moving forward while turning right) 
So, basically for any (r, theta), I can set speeds as,
(left_speed, right_speed) = (alpha*r, beta*r)
I need to formulate an equation where I can generalize all these cases by finding alpha and beta based on theta.
How can I do this? Is there is any existing work I can refer to?

2021,Telemetry with Ardupilot 2.6,"I'm using the telemetry kit from 3DR robotics (433MHz) to interface with Ardupilot Mega 2.6, controlling a quadcopter. The Mission Planner (v1.2.84) by Michael Oborne works well with the telemetry kit, transmitting flight data (IMU, compass, GPS etc.) from the quadcopter to the GCS and displaying them in their GUI.
However, I would like to see the same data in the hyperterminal (windows system). The radio receiver on the GCS connects to my PC through a USB drive. I have tried calling the remote radio station using all possible Baud rates, starting from 110 to 921600 (including 57600). I've set the data bits to 8 and stop bits to 1. 'None' for parity and flow control.
However, all that I ever get on my terminal is either gibberish or no data at all. I also tried burning this software to the radio receiver and tried using AT commands on the radio. 
It connects OK with '+++', but keeps returning error for AT1, ATT etc.
Please give me an idea about how to get flight data at the hyperterminal.

2022,How will the currently evaluated computer technology influence robotics and embedded systems in the forseeable future?,"This is my first question on this site, might be a little subjective :)
There is an ongoing process of many cool cyclonic changes of technology in the electronics and software industry.
Concurrency and Parallelism
What will be the implications of GPGPU, Multi-core  and ""programming in the large"" model in the specific case of embedded software, and how will it influence the styles and conventions in the community?
Single board multicore hardware like soon to be released Parallela can be an example?
Programming language research
The results have been excellent. Functional Programming has supposedly started reaching the masses. It was late night previous weekend when I briefly skimmed through an example of functional reactive programming to solve real time problems. AI people are also suggesting that we should be programming our robots in Declarative Domain Specific languages soon. It would be nice to know the implications on the robotics community. 
There has been a tremendous growth of frameworks like ROS and Urbi too!! That should be the region to look upon.. 
Most of the robotics, embedded and high performance AI codebase directly depends on C/C++ , and though languages like Rust and D are bubbling up, wouldn't it take massive amount of time to adopt the new languages, if ever adaptation begins? 
AI
Correct me, but it seems like a lot of time has passed and there are not many major production results from the AI community. I've heard about cognitive architectures of old like ACT-R and 4CAPS. They seem to be in hibernation mode! 
There seems to be a lot of work lately on otherwise intelligent systems (solved problems) like Computer vision and Data mining, but these problems cater to supercomputing and industrial crowd more. Could there be any possible shift towards low powered systems soon?

--The gears need be 2-3 inches in diameter, and they will bear only a very light load (much less than 1 foot pound), so the material need not be strong or machinable. 
--The tolerances need only be sufficient for the teeth to mate robustly, preventing any hang.  Unfortunately, I do not have a sense of what tolerances will allow gears to mate properly.
--(If the machine is precise enough to print a hole to statically mate with a shaft of a specified dimensions due to friction, excellent.  If not, I can probably improvise a tiny shaft hole with adhesive.)
--Because this may be used in close proximity to pavement, a melting temperature in excess of 100F is desirable but not required.  
--Because any given element will interact kinetically only with other elements that have also been 3D printed (except a metallic shaft), compatibility with external resources is not required.

2036,Making high CAN baud rates work,"I'm dealing with a board that no matter what I do I can't seem to make CAN work over 125kbit/s. I'll give some detail about the board on the bottom, but I'm going to keep this question generic.
First of all, regarding hardware. From what I've gathered, there isn't any need for a pull-up resistor on the TX of CAN. Is that correct? It may perhaps be chip-specific, but wherever I see, it seems that the TX/RX lines are directly connected to the transceiver.
Second, regarding bit-timing: Using different calculators, for example, Kvaser or the one from Microchip, I can see the following configuration (for 64kHz input clock):

I've seen this from more than one source. Furthermore, the numbers fit to the formula in the datasheet of the microcontroller.
However, only the configuration for 125kbit/s works for me. I'm using CANreal to monitor the messages.
I've tried different configurations for the CAN, for example with 16 time quanta instead of 8 as well as changing my microcontroller's clock to 16MHz and using again different values. Regardless of all that, speeds higher than 125kbit/s result in only errors and warnings in CANreal (which are taken from the CAN driver). Note that the same CAN board, driver and software works with 1Mbit/s with some other hardware I have.
This all is made harder since, as soon as I put a probe from my oscillator on the TX line, it becomes a continuous 0-1 alteration like the following:
      __------     __------     __------     __------     __------
     /       |    /       |    /       |    /       |    /       |
   /         |  /         |  /         |  /         |  /         |
  /          | /          | /          | /          | /          |
  |          | |          | |          | |          | |          |
  |          |_|          |_|          |_|          |_|          |

Which is not something I would be outputting by software. In fact, as soon as I remove the probe, the messages start arriving (again, only at 125Mbit/s). So basically, I don't seem to be able to have any oscillator debugging available.
Back to my ""first of all, regarding hardware"", the shape of the signal suggests a pull-up resistor may be necessary, but I haven't seen the need for that in any datasheet I found. Furthermore, my microcontroller configures the pin when used as CAN, so I don't have control over making it push-pull (since it looks like it's open-drain). Not to mention the microcontroller doesn't even have a configuration to make the pin push-pull.
Is there any hidden parameter somewhere that should also be set? Is a pull-up resistor necessary after all? Why would the oscillator probe cause such a behavior?

Details from the board:

MCU: P18F45K80. CAN is connected to its default RB2 and RB3.

Now, when I connect pin 1 (enable 1) to the positive rail, the motor spins, which is expected.

But when I measure voltage on the NO pins, I get 0V. Has anyone else seen this? I have two of these relays and I can't seem to get voltage on the NO pins with either relay. I should clarify that I'm expecting the same 5V power source to power both the coil and the common pins. If the NC pins work then I don't see why the NO pins shouldn't. In both cases the 5V is shared between the coil and any load attached to the NC/NO pins.

2088,Powering down servos completely in RobotC+Tetrix,"For a certain robotic application (actually for the FTC challenge this year) our team is performing an operation where a servo-driven arm could potentially be forced into an unknown position. We are using NXT+Tetrix.
Since this could damage a powered servo working against this forced position (servo holding arm weight on fixed base is now trying to move heavy base relative to fixed arm), we are thinking about somehow de-powering our servos (or servo controller), in order to get the servos to ""relax"" and accept the mechanically-forced position.
Originally, we were thinking of having our RobotC code determine the physical position of a given servo and set its desired position to there every loop, limiting how much a servo would try to fight the movement, but to our dismay,  actually gives us the setpoint, and not the physical location (due to the servo being unable to provide this information).
We also considered setting ServoChangeRate[fooServo] to 1(the minimal value) but this only changes the rate of the target location changing relative to the previous target.
So, we're concluding that the only way to really do this is to fully depower the servos. Is this possible on NXT/Tetrix with RobotC?
A few notes:

I realized as well that one could suggest to rig an encoder(associated with a Tetrix motor that does not need an encoder) onto the rotating area. That actually would not work for mechanical constraints.
I looked into setting PWM enable as shown here but am not sure how to send the i2c commands needed. If someone could clue me in to how these commands would be sent in terms of c code, that would be very helpful.

For the simple case of multinomial re-sampling, I can assume that we can model the process like a Binomial distribution if we only care about one sample/particle.
So if the particle has a weight of w that is also the probability that it will get selected in a step of the re-sampling. So we use 1 - P(k, p, n) where P is the Binomial distribution, k is 0 (we did not select the particle in all our tries), p is equal to w and n is equal to M, the number of particles.
What is the case though in the systematic re-sampling, where the probability of a particle being selected is proportional but not equal to its weight?

2130,Transform Image Using Roll-Pitch-Yaw Angles (image rectification),"UPDATE: This exact problem has been solved in StackOverflow. Please read this post there for further explanation and a working solution. Thanks!
I am working on an application where I need to rectify an image taken from a mobile camera platform. The platform measures roll, pitch and yaw angles, and I want to make it look like the image is taken from directly above, by some sort of transform from this information. 
In other words, I want a perfect square lying flat on the ground, photographed from afar with some camera orientation, to be transformed, so that the square is perfectly symmetrical afterwards. 
I have been trying to do this through OpenCV(C++) and Matlab, but I seem to be missing something fundamental about how this is done.
In Matlab, I have tried the following:

Where R_z/y/x are the standard rotational matrices (implemented with degrees).
For some yaw-rotation, it all works just fine:
R = R_z(10)*R_y(0)*R_x(0);

Which gives the result:

If I try to rotate the image by the same amount about the X- or Y- axes, I get results like this:
R = R_z(10)*R_y(0)*R_x(10);


However, if I rotate by 10 degrees, divided by some huge number, it starts to look OK. But then again, this is a result that has no research value what so ever:
R = R_z(10)*R_y(0)*R_x(10/1000);


Can someone please help me understand why rotating about the X- or Y-axes makes the transformation go wild? Is there any way of solving this without dividing by some random number and other magic tricks? Is this maybe something that can be solved using Euler parameters of some sort?

From what I understand, SPIread(...,...) returns an analog voltage value from the data pins of the sensor, which happens to be proportional to the acceleration values. Right?
My question is: How do I go about calibrating the accelerometer?
What I've tried till date: I've tried the ""place horizontal... place nose down... left side, right side"" technique used by mission planner. 
Basically, when placed on horizontal position, the sensor is experiencing +1g on it's Z axis and 0g in X and Y axis. Left/right side provides 1g on Y axis and nose down/up provides 1g on X axis. 
Now for every orientation, I've passed the raw sensor data through a LPF and then computed the mean, median and SD of this sensor data over 100 iterations. I store this mean, median and SD value in the EEPROM for each axis (one for +1g and one for 0g).
Now, when I use the sensor, I load the stats from the EEPROM, match the mean/median and standard deviation with the current reading of 4/5 iterations. 
Here I'm working under the assumption that the values between 0g and +1g (and anything above 1g) can be interpolated/extrapolated from the data using a linear plot. 

Is this the correct approach for calibration?
Can you suggest a better way?
I noticed that the maxima/minima for each axis is different. Is this
the expected outcome or is there something wrong in the code?
What do I do with the gyro? How to calibrate for angular
acceleration?

Usually there are sensors which send feedback to the microcontroller or the computer and the controller sends a signal w.r.t the input signal from sensors.

2149,Extended Kalman Filter with Laser Scan + Known Map,"I am currently working on a project for school where I need to implement an extended Kalman Filter for a point robot with a laser scanner. The Robot can rotate with 0 degree turn radius and drive forward. All motions are piecewise linear (drive,rotate,drive).
The simulator we are using does not support acceleration, all motion is instantaneous. 
We also have a known map (png image) that we need to localize in. We can ray trace in the image in order to simulate laser scans. 
My partner and I are little confused as to the motion and sensor models we'll need to use. 
So far we are modelling the state as a vector $(x,y,\theta)$.
We are using the update equations as follows

We thought we had everything working until we noticed that we forgot to initialize P and that it was zero, meaning that there was no correction happening. Apparently our propagation was very accurate as we haven't yet introduced noise into the system.
For the motion model we are using the following matrix for F:
$F = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & -v*\Delta t*sin(\theta)  
\\ 0 & 1 & v*\Delta t*cos(\theta)   
\\ 0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}$
As its the Jacobian of our update formulas. Is this correct?
For the sensor model we are approximating the Jacobian (H) by taking finite differences of the robots $x$, $y$ and $\theta$ positions and ray tracing in the map. We talked to the TA who said that this would work but I'm still unsure it will. Our prof is away so we can't ask him unfortunately. We are using 3 laser measurements per correction step so H is a 3x3. 
The other issue where having how to initialize P. We tried 1,10,100 and they all place the robot outside the map at (-90,-70) when the map is only 50x50.
The code for our project can be found here: 
Any advice is greatly appreciated.
EDIT:
At this point I've gotten the filter to stabilize with basic movement noise but no actual movement. As soon as the robot starts to move the filter diverges quite quickly and exits the map.

2167,Quadcopter instability with simple takeoff in autonomous mode,"I'm trying to get a quad rotor to fly. The on board controller is an Ardupilot Mega 2.6, being programmed by Arduino 1.0.5.
I'm trying to fly it in simple autonomous mode, no Radio controller involved. I've done a thorough static weight balancing of the assembly (somewhat like this: ) and the propellers are balanced correctly.
I'm trying to get the quadcopter to lift using this code:

But the issue is, as soon as the quadcopter takes off, it tilts heavily in one direction and topples over. 
It looks like one of the motor/propeller is not generating enough thrust for that arm to take-off. I've even tried offsetting the weight balance against the direction that fails to lift, but it doesn't work (and I snapped a few propellers in the process);

Is there something wrong with the way the ESCs are being fired using
the Servo library?
If everything else fails, am I to assume there is something wrong
with the motors?
Do I need to implement a PID controller for self-balancing the roll
and pitch just to get this quadrotor to take off?

Edit 1:    Thanks for all the replies.
I got the PID in place. Actually, it is still a PD controller with the integral gain set to zero. 
Here's how I'm writing the angles to the servo:
motor1.write((int)(val + (kP * pError1) +(kI * iError1) +(kD * dError1)));  //front left
motor2.write((int)(val + (kP * pError2) +(kI * iError2) +(kD * dError2)));  //rear right
motor3.write((int)(val + (kP * pError3) +(kI * iError3) +(kD * dError3)));  //front right
motor4.write((int)(val + (kP * pError4) +(kI * iError4) +(kD * dError4)));  //rear left 

kI is zero, so I'll ignore that.
With the value of kP set somewhere between 0.00051 to 0.00070, I'm getting an oscillation of steady amplitude around a supposed mean value. But the problem is, the amplitude of oscillation is way too high. It is somewhere around +/- 160 degrees, which looks crazy even on a tightly constrained test rig. 

[  Edit 2: How I calculate the term 'pError' - Simple linear thresholding. 
I've a precomputed data of the average readings (mean and SD) coming out of the gyro when the IMU is steady. Based on the gyro reading, I classify any motion of the setup as left, right, forward or backward. 
For each of these motion, I increase the pError term for two of the motors, i.e, for right tilt, I add pError terms to motors 2 & 3, for left tilt, I add pError term to motors 1 & 4 etc. (check the comment lines in the code snippet given above). 
The magnitude of error I assign to the pError term is = abs(current gyro reading) - abs(mean steady-state gyro reading). This value is always positive, therefore the side that is dipping downwards will always have a positive increment in RPM.  ]

As I crank up the derivative gain to around 0.0010 to 0.0015, the oscillation dampens rapidly and the drone comes to a relatively stable attitude hold, but not on the horizontal plane. The oscillation dies down (considerably, but not completely) only to give me a stable quadrotor tilted at 90 - 100 degrees with horizontal. 
I'm using only the gyros for calculating the error. The gyros were self calibrated, hence I do expect a fair amount of noise and inaccuracy associated with the error values. 

Do you think that is the primary reason for the high amplitude
oscillation?

One other probable reason might be the low update frequency of the errors. I'm updating the errors 6 times a second. 

Could that be a probable reason it is taking longer to stabilise the
error?

And, for the steady state error after the wild oscillations dampen, is it necessary to fine tune the integral gain to get rid of that?
Please help.

Edit 3:  I cranked up the frequency of operation to 150+ Hz and what I get now is a very controlled oscillation (within +/- 10 degrees). 
I'm yet to tune the derivative gain, following which I plan to recompute the errors for the integral gain using a combination of gyro and accelerometer data. 

Edit 4:  I've tuned the P and D gain, resulting in +/- 5 degrees oscillation(approx). I can't get it to any lower than this, no matter how much I try.
There are two challenges about which I'm deeply concerned:
After 5 to 8 seconds of flight, the quadcopter is leaning into one side, albeit slowly. 
A) Can this drift be controlled by tuning the integral gain?
B) Can the drift be controlled by using accelerometer + gyro fused data?
C) Given that my drone still shows +/- 5 degrees oscillation, can I consider this the optimal set point for the proportional and derivative gains? Or do I need to search more? (In which case, I'm really at my wits end here!)

It does some setup then runs my app. It also listens to the usb cable so that if I upload some code it erases the old one and run the new one. There are 2 sections in the memory, one for the bootloader (S1) and one for the app (S2). Code on S1 can write to S2 but not to S1 (or strongly discouraged I don't remember).
There are things that I don't understand though :

If I upload some new code while my app is running, the upload works. What happened ? I thought that the bootloader gave hand to my app
How can we flash a new bootloader ? If the bootloader is the thing that runs on section 1 (S1) and can only write to S2 and if the bootloader is the only thing that listens to new code uploads, ...

2236,ComputerCraft (Minecraft mod) navigation: Collision avoidance and path planning/finding in 2D/3D space,"I'm programming Lua for controlling computers and robots in-game in the Minecraft mod ComputerCraft.
ComputerCraft has these robots called Turtles, that are able to move around in the grid based(?) world of Minecraft. They are also equipped with sensors making them able to detect blocks (obstacles) adjacent to them. Turtles execute Lua programs written by a player.
As a hobby project I would like to program a  function for my Turtles. Some Turtles actually have equipment to remove obstacles, but I would like to make them avoid obstacles and thus prevent the destruction of the in-game environment.
I have no prior experience in robotics, but I have a B.Sc. in Computer Science and am now a lead web developer.
I did some research and found some basic strategies, namely grid based and quadtree based. As I have no experience in this area, these strategies might be old school.
Note that Turtles are able to move in three dimensions (even hover in any height). I could share the obstacles as well as obstacle free coordinates in a common database as they are discovered if that would help me out, as most obstacles are stationary once they are placed.
What are my best options in this matter? Are there any easy fixes? Where do I look for additional resources?
Thank you very much in advance! :-)
EDIT: Thank you for your feedback!
I started reading the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd Edition to get up to speed on basic theory as suggested by Ian. Pointers to other educational resources are appreciated.
Also, I started developing a basic navigation algorithm for moving in unexplored areas, similar to what Cube suggested.
The priority for me is as few moves as possible, as it costs time and fuel cells for each additional move (approx. 0.8 seconds and 1 fuel cell per move in either direction). I plan on using the Euclidean heuristics function in a Greedy Best-First Search for computing a path that is expected to be quite optimal in reducing the number of moves to reach the goal, if enough data is available from the shared database from previous exploration.
Each time an obstacle is reached, I plan to use the following very basic algorithm, exploiting the fact that Turtles are able to move vertically:
1. Calculate direct horizontal path to the goal.
2. Turn to the direction of the next step of the path.
3. If an obstacle is detected in front of the Turtle go to 5. If this is the 4th time that an obstacle is detected in front of the Turtle after moving up, go to 6.
4. Move forward, go to 2.
5. If no obstacle is detected above the Turtle, move up and go to 3, else go to 7.
6. Backtrack to the coordinates the Turtle was in before moving upwards.
7. Turn left, go to 3.

When using this algorithm, records are kept of the explored coordinates and uploaded to a shared database. However, there are some cases, that I did not consider:
- When should it move down?
- What if the goal is not reachable from a coordinate directly above it?
- If no horizontal move in any direction is possible, how long should it backtrack?
- How to detect unreachable goals (obstacles can then be removed if requested)

Maybe if enough exploration data of the area is available, a Jump Point Search is performed to calculate an optimal path. However this assumes a 2D map. How can I take the 3rd dimension into account?
Also, what would be a good data structure to store the exploration data?

From the Raspberry Pi, I'm able to rotate the servo as a test clockwise for one second, counter-clockwise for one second, then stop the servo, with the following Python script:
#!/usr/bin/env python
from Arduino import Arduino
import time

board = Arduino(9600, port='/dev/ttyACM0')

board.Servos.attach(9) # Declare servo on pin 9
board.Servos.write(9, 0) # Move servo to full speed, clockwise
time.sleep(1) # Sleep for 1 second
print board.Servos.read(9) # Speed check (should read ""0"")

board.Servos.write(9, 180)

print board.Servos.read(9) # (Should read ""180"")

board.Servos.write(9, 90)
print board.Servos.read(9)
board.Servos.detach(9)

The output via the Raspberry Pi terminal reads:
0
180
90

Although this only performs full-speed in both direction (as well as the calibrated ""stop"" speed of 90), I have successfully alternated from a full-speed to slower speeds, for example, going from 0 up to 90 in increments of 10.
From the Raspberry Pi, I'm able to send input from my Xbox controller to drive the servo with a small custom Python script I've created along with xboxdrv (which works flawlessly with other projects I'm doing):
#!/usr/bin/python

from legopi.lib import xbox_read
from Arduino import Arduino

# To catch Ctrl+C
import signal
import sys

# The deadzone within which we ignore inputs, approximately 1/3 of total possible input
DEADZONE = 12000

def signal_handler(signal, frame):

    sys.exit(0)

# Capture Ctrl+C so we can shut down nicely
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

print ""Starting Wrapper""
print ""Press Ctrl+C at any time to quit""

board = Arduino(9600, port='/dev/ttyACM0')

board.Servos.write(9, 90)

for event in xbox_read.event_stream(deadzone=DEADZONE):
    print ""Xbox event: %s"" % (event)

    # If the RB button it's being held, rotate the servo counter-clockwise at full-speed.
    # When the RB button is released, stop the servo.
    if(event.key=='RB'):
        if(event.value>0):
            board.Servos.write(9, 180)
            print board.Servos.read(9)
        else:
            board.Servos.write(9, 90)
            print board.Servos.read(9)
        continue

This script runs, and I'm able to control the servo using the RB button on my controller. However, it eventually fails - sometimes after minutes, sometimes after seconds (rapid and intermittent input seemingly having no influence on expediting a crash). Input is no longer read by the script, the terminal comes to a halt, the servo freezes on whatever the last command given was (either spinning endlessly or stopped), and I'm forced to Ctrl + C out of the script. If I check to see if the Arduino is still connected to the Raspberry Pi, it shows that it has reconnected itself to the Raspberry Pi as ""ttyACM1"" (from /dev/ttyACM0 to /dev/ttyACM1):
pi@raspberrypi ~/robotarm $ dir /dev/ttyA*
/dev/ttyACM1  /dev/ttyAMA0

Why does the Arduino reconnect itself? Is there some other way I should be processing this information? Distance to the wireless Xbox receiver is not a factor as all of these pieces are adjacent to one another for testing purposes. It will prove impossible to use this servo as a wheel for my robot if I'm constantly tending to this issue.

2274,Workable low-resolution object/target recognition pattern and library?,"I've spent quite some time researching this, but most of my Google search results have turned up academic research papers that are interesting but not very practical.
I'm working on a target/pattern recognition project** where a robot with a small camera attached to it will attempt to locate targets using a small wireless camera as it moves around a room. The targets will ideally be as small as possible (something like the size of a business card or smaller), but could be (less ideally) as large as 8x10 inches. The targets will be in the form of something easily printable.
The pattern recognition software needs to be able to recognize if a target (only one at a time) is in the field of vision, and needs to be able to accurately differentiate between at least 12 different target patterns, hopefully from maybe a 50x50 pixel portion of a 640x480 image.
Before playing with the camera, I had envisioned using somewhat small printed barcodes and the excellent zxing library to recognize the barcodes.
As it turns out, the camera's resolution is terrible - 640x480, and grainy and not well-focused. Here is an example still image. It's not very well-suited for capturing barcodes, especially while moving. I think it could work with 8x10 barcodes, but that's really larger than I'm looking for. (I'm using this particular camera because it is tiny, light, cheap, and includes a battery and wi-fi.)
I'm looking for two things: a suggestion or pointer to an optimal pattern that I could use for my targets, and a software library and/or algorithm that can help me identify these patterns from images. I have NO idea where to start with the right type of pattern so suggestions there would really help, especially if there is a project out there that does something resembling this. I've found OpenCV and OpenSIFT which both seem like potential candidates for software libraries, but neither seemed to have examples of doing the type of recognition I'm talking about. I'm thinking picking the right type of pattern is the big hurdle to overcome here, so any pointers to the optimal type of pattern would be great. Being able to recognize the pattern from all different angles is a must.
So far, my idea is to use patterns that perhaps look something like this, where the three concentric color rings are simply either red, green, or blue - allowing for up to 27 unique targets, or 81 if I use 4 rings. From about 2 feet, the capture of a 3x3 inch target (from my computer screen) looks like this which seems like it would be suitable for analysis but I feel like there should be a better type of pattern that would be more compact and easier to recognize - maybe just a plain black and white pattern of some sort with shapes on it?
Pointers to an optimal approach for this are greatly appreciated.

The robot is operated through WiFi and has 2 motors that will react on any input signals.
Imagine user drawing a path for this robot on smartphone screen. It has aquired all the points on XY axis, every time beginning with (0,0). Still I have no idea, how to somehow ""convert"" just points, into voltage input to both motors. Signals will be sent in approx. 60Hz connection, so quite fast. Maybe not every single axis point will be taken into consideration, there will be surely some skips, but that is irrelevant, since this path does not have to be done perfectly by the robot, just in reasonable error scale.
Do you have any idea on how to make the robot follow defined axis points that overall create a path?
Edit 10.01:
The voltage will be computed by the robot, so input on both is between -255 and 255 and the velocity should increase or decrease lineary in those borders.
Additionaly, I would like to solve it as if there were perfect conditions, I don't need any feedback crazy models. Let's assume that all the data is true, no sensors and additional devices. Just XY axis path and required input (ommit wheel slide too).

The Robot has 38 Degrees of Freedom and has a computer some sensors and motor boards. The motors are powered through Motor Boards. All these boards are powered through a main power board that exists at the robots chest.
My model should be able to predict the power for any trajectory of the robot. Say for instance if the robot raises its hand from 0 degrees to 180 degrees my model should be able to predict the power.
Heres an idea I came across. My idea was to equate the electrical torque to the mechanical torque of each joint.
For instance if the Right arm pitch moves from 0 to 180 degrees I can do as follows ?
$mgsin(\theta)= Kt*I$
However, I am not getting a proper prediction and the current value is way off than what we can read from a software installed in the robot. I know there are losses but even then its off. I was wondering if there are any other approaches or a fault in my approach.

2297,Quadcopter PID tuning,"In continuation of the question I asked here: Quadcopter instability with simple takeoff in autonomous mode
  ...I'd like to ask a few questions about implementing a basic PID for a quadrotor controlled by an APM 2.6 module. (I'm using a frame from 3DRobotics)
I've stripped down the entire control system to just two PID blocks, one for controlling roll and another for controlling pitch (yaw and everything else... I'd think about them later).
I'm testing this setup on a rig which consists of a freely rotating beam, wherein I've tied down two of the arms of the quadrotor. The other two are free to move. So, I'm actually testing one degree of freedom (roll or pitch) at a time.
Check the image below: here A, B marks the freely rotating beam on which the setup is mounted.

With careful tuning of P and D parameters, I've managed to attain a sustained flight of about 30 seconds. 
But by 'sustained', I simple mean a test where the drone ain't toppling over to one side. Rock steady flight is still no where in sight, and more than 30 secs of flight also looks quite difficult. It wobbles from the beginning. By the time it reaches 20 - 25 seconds, it starts tilting to one side. Within 30 secs, it has tilted to one side by an unacceptable margin. Soon enough, I find it resting upside down 
As for the PID code itself, I'm calculating the proportional error from a 'complimentary filter' of gyro + accelerometer data. The integral term is set to zero. The P term comes to about 0.39 and the D term is at 0.0012. (I'm not using the Arduino PID library on purpose, just want to get one of my own PIDs implemented here.)
Check this video, if you want to see how it works.

[Yeh, the setup is pretty ancient! I agree. :)]
Please let me know what could I possibly do to improve stability at this stage.
@Ian: Of the many tests I did with my setup, I did plot graphs for some of the tests using the reading from the serial monitor. Here is a sample reading of Roll vs 'Motor1 & Motor2 - PWM input' (the two motors controlling the roll):

As for the input/output:
Input: Roll and pitch values (in degrees), as obtained by a combination of accelerometer + gyro
Output: PWM values for the motors, delivered using the Servo library's motor.write() function

Resolution
I resolved the problem. Here's how:

The crux of the issue lied in the way I implemented the Arduino program. I was using the write() function to update the servo angles, which happens to accept only integer steps in the argument (or somehow responds only to integer input, 100 and 100.2 produces the same result). I changed it to writeMicroseconds() and that made the copter considerably steadier.
I was adding up RPM on one motor while keeping the other at a steady value. I changed this to increase RPM in one motor while decreasing the opposing motor. That kinda keeps the total horizontal thrust unchanged, which might help me when I'm trying to get vertical altitude hold on this thing.
I was pushing up the RPM to the max limit, which is why the quadcopter kept losing control at full throttle. There was no room for the RPM to increase when it sensed a tilt.
I observed that one of the motor was inherently weaker than the other one, I do not know why. I hardcoded an offset into that motors PWM input.

Thanks for all the support.

2298,"How much accuracy could I get position tracking with a 3-axis accelerometer and gyro sensor, and compass, and how would I do it?","Given a 12' x 12' field (4m x 4m), a reasonably cheap 3-axis gyro sensor and accelerometer, and compass, I plan to design a device capable of tracking its position to sub-centimeter accuracy for a minute of motion or so.
The device has a holonomic drive system, capable of moving any direction at a maximum of about 8mph (3.6m/s), with a maximum acceleration of about 2g's. However, there are some simplifying constraints. For one, the field is nearly flat. The floor is made of a tough foam, so there is slight sinking, but the floor is flat except for a ramp of known angle (to a few degrees). The device will, excepting collisions, not be rising above the floor.
Accuracy is preferred over simplicity, so any mathematics required on the software side to improve the system would be welcomed.
Before I definitively choose accelerometers as the method of position tracking, though, I would like some idea of how much accuracy I could get, and the best ways of doing it.

The hardware cost per seat needs to be $5.
I'm looking for all solutions.  Web cams, preasure sensors, sonars, lasers, arduino, pi, intel edison, anything. 
Obviously there cannot be wires that people could trip over.  Sensors on the ceiling could have wired networking.  Sensors on the seat or floor would need to have wireless communication.  sensors on the ceiling would need to consider occlusion by people sitting in the seats (think, if there is an empty spot between 2 people, can the sensor see it as empty)
In the end, the data needs to be collected as a simple list of which chairs are occupied/open

Possible solutions:

rasberry pi's on the ceiling every 8 seats with a camera.   
pressure sensors under chair legs wired to pi's gpio
Drones flying around the auditorium :)

Any ideas?
Update (more constraints):

auditorium size is 400 seats
Installation costs should average 10 chairs per hour(400/10 = 40 hours)  
as the picture shows, chairs are cushioned
regular maintenance should take no longer than 30 min. per 2-hour event(eg, batteries)
hardware should last 100 sessions
for auditorium cleaning, it should be possible to ""disconnect"" and ""reconnect"" the chairs with 4 hours of labor.

2315,Overcorrecting Kalman Filter,"I'm trying to get an extended Kalman Filter to work. My System Model is:
$ x = \begin{bmatrix}
 lat \\
 long \\
 \theta
\end{bmatrix}$
where lat and long are latitude and longitude (in degree) and $\theta$ is the current orientation of my vehicle (also in degree).
In my Prediction Step I get a reading for current speed v, yaw rate $\omega$ and inclination angle $\alpha$:
$z = \begin{bmatrix}
 v \\
 \alpha\\
 \omega 
 \end{bmatrix}$
I use the standard prediction for the EKF with $f()$ being:
$
\vec{f}(\vec{x}_{u,t}, \vec{z}_t) = \vec{x}_{u,t} + 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{v}{f} * \cos(\theta) * \cos(\alpha) * \frac{180 }{\pi * R_0} \\
  \frac{v}{f} * \sin(\theta) * \cos(\alpha) * \frac{180 }{\pi * R_0} * \frac{1}{\cos(lat)} \\
  \frac{\omega}{f}
 \end{bmatrix}
$
$f$ being the prediction frequency, $R_0$ being the radius of the earth (modelling the earth as a sphere)
My Jacobian Matrix looks like this:
$
C = v \cdot \Delta t \cdot cos(\alpha) \cdot \frac{180}{\pi R_0}
$
$
F_J =
\begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 & -C \cdot sin(\phi) \cdot \frac{1}{cos(lat)} \\
  -C \cdot sin(\phi) \cdot \frac{sin(lat)}{{cos(lat)}^2} & 1 & C \cdot cos(\phi) \cdot \frac{1}{cos(lat)}\\
  0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$
As I have a far higher frequency on my sensors for the prediction step, I have about 10 predictions followed by one update.
In the update step I get a reading for the current GPS position and calculate an orientation from the current GPS position and the previous one. Thus my update step is just the standard EKF Update with $h(x) = x$ and thus the Jacobian Matrix to $h()$, $H$ being the Identity.
Trying my implementation with testdata where the GPS Track is in constant northern direction and the yaw rate constantly turns west, I expect the filter to correct my position close to the track and the orientation to 355 degrees or so. What actually happens can be seen in the image attached (Red: GPS Position Measurements, Green/blue: predicted positions): 
I have no Idea what to do about this. I'm not very experienced with the Kalman filter, so it might just be me misunderstanding something, but nothing I tried seemed to work
What I think:
I poked around a bit: If I set the Jacobian Matrix in the prediction to be the identity, it works really good. The Problem seems to be that $P$ (the covariance Matrix of the system model) is not zero in $P(3,1)$ and $P(3,2)$. My interpretation would be that in the prediction step the Orientation depends on the Position, which does not seem to make sense. This is due to $F_J(2,1)$ not being zero, which in turn makes sense.
Can anyone give me a hint where the overcorrection may come from, or what I should look at / google for?

2357,Cons and pros of wireless technologies for rescue robot,"robotics enthusiasts!
I'm a member of a team which has to develop a mobile rescue robot to cooperate with firemen (e.g. on earthquake sites).
The problem we have is connection of a commander post with the robot. The robot has to enter buildings, so it is desirable that the connection can go through several decimeters of walls and have a reach 50-100 meters. On the other hand, we need to send a lot of data (camera images, point clouds, maps) which can easily eat 10 Mbps or more.
At this time we use 2.4 GHz WiFi for this connection. As for the speed, with direct visibility it seems to be sufficient, but only when a single robot is operating (we can use up to 3 non-overlapping channels, so in theory 3 robots can work together; but usually you have the environment messed up with home routers). We need at least 5 robots to be operating simultaneousely.
We have tried 5 GHz WiFi, but it has problems with penetrating walls, so it can only be used for UAVs.
My idea was to use some mobile connection technology like LTE. I found that LTE can be run on 800 MHz, which could be great for the wall penetration performance. I also found that the LTE's theoretical upload speeds (for clients) are 70 Mbps, but nobody says if it is on 2.6 GHz and how would it be changed when running LTE on 800 MHz.
Moreover, we cannot rely on some provider's coverage. I have found that you can build your own LTE transmitter for about 2000, which seems to be interesting to us. Maybe it is possible to build it even cheaper. But we think both 2.6 GHz and 800 MHz are regulated frequencies. However, the cooperation with firefighters could persuade local regulators to give an exception to us to setup our own small LTE base station.
And now to the question: do you think such setup would give better results than using WiFi? Or do you know of any other technologies that would help us to either increase the bandwidth or the wall penetration performance? What are their cons and pros?

My initial idea was to buy a cheap RC car, remove all electronics and replace them with my own. This approach almost worked. I purchased this New Bright F-150 Truck.  The size is good and there is plenty of storage space:


However, I quickly ran into a problem with this thing. I assumed that the front wheel would be turned by some kind of servo. Instead I found this nonsense:


That small gear shaft is not driven by a servo - it's a conventional motor, which spins until it is jammed at the extremes of travel. The wheels are straightened when power is removed by a small spring on the other side. This means that there is only one angle at which the wheels can be turned, and that angle is way too small for what I need. So using this RC car will not work.
Before I start buying more things, I would like to hear some opinions from more experienced people. Am I on the right track? Do I simply need to get a better RC car, or are they all designed like this? Perhaps there are other options that would be more suitable for what I am doing?

2365,covariance matrix in EKF?,"I'm struggling with the concept of covariance matrix. 
$$
\Sigma
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{xx} & \sigma_{xy} & \sigma_{x \theta} \\
\sigma_{yx} & \sigma_{yy} & \sigma_{y \theta} \\
\sigma_{\theta x} & \sigma_{\theta y} & \sigma_{\theta \theta} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Now, my understanding for $\sigma_{xx}$, $\sigma_{yy}$, and $\sigma_{\theta \theta}$ that they describe the uncertainty. For example, for $\sigma_{xx}$, it describes the uncertainty of the value of x. Now, my question about the rest of sigmas, what do they represent? What does it mean if they are zeros? I can interpret that if $\sigma_{xx}$ is zero, it means I don't have uncertainty about the value of x. 

Note, I'm reading Principles of Robot Motion - Theory, Algorithms, and Implementations by Howie Choset et. al., which states that

By this definition $\sigma_{ii}$ is the same as $\sigma_{i}^{2}$ the variance of $X_{i}$. For $i  j$, if $\sigma_{ij} = 0$, then $X_{i}$ and $X_{j}$ are independent of each other.

This may answer my question if the rest of sigmas are zeros however, I'm still confused about the relationship between these variables for example $x$ and $y$. When does this happen? I mean the correlation between them. Or in other words, can I assume them to be zeros?
Another book namely FastSLAM: A Scalable Method ... by Michael and Sebastian which states 

The off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of this
  multivariate Gaussian encode the correlations between pairs of state
  variables.

They don't mention when the correlation might happen and what does it mean?

I want to integrate this into Monte-Carlo observation step.
I'm storing the map of the maze as a set of Line segments. What would be a nice way to implement the sensor update, i.e. given the position (x,y) of the robot what is the probability that it is found there given the above described coordinates of the walls.

The main idea I currently have:
Transform points in polar coordinates. Then for each point (from vision output) compute a ray with this angle and find the first intersection with the maze. Now we have the predicted distance and real distance and we can compute the probability that this measurement is right. 
The main drawback is that this is slow. For each point from vision output I have to iterate over all line segments to find the one with the closest intersection. The line segments number is around 50. So it gets to O(400*50*Particle number).

2382,Motion Model for Holonomic Robot,"We are working with an holonomic robot equipped with three (120 degree shifted) omnidirectional wheels. The relative movement is estimated by dead reckoning using wheel encoders. To improve this estimation we installed an gyroscope to measure the change in orientation. Furthermore the robot has a 270 degree laser range finder. 
In order to solve the kidnapped robot problem we implemented a particle filter. In every step each particle is updated according to the odometry and gyroscope readings. Since these readings are distorted by noise we need a motion model to include these errors. As described in Probabilistic Robotics by Thrun (Page 118 - 143) there are two commonly used motion models (velocity motion model and odometry motion model). However these models seem to describe the behavior of differential drive robots not omnidirectional robots. I base this thesis on the fact that the error in relative y-direction is proportional to the error in orientation as far as the motion models by Thrun are concerned. This is appropriate for differential drive robots as the orientation and the heading of the robot are identical. For omnidirectional robots this assumption can not be made since the heading and the orientation are completely independent. Even if we assume perfect information about the robots orientation we can still obtain error in relative y-direction.
I would like to discuss if my assumption - that the velocity/odometry motion model fails for omnididrectional robots - is correct or not as i am not sure about that. Furthermore  i am curious if there are any other motion models for omnidirectional robots that might fit better.

I'd like to use an onboard android phone to do the image processing and recognition part, so that I avoid to send the video stream to a control station, process it and send back the commands.
As I need to use it in an indoor environment (so no GPS coordinate), I need the phone to guide the quadcopter giving it relative directions like FORWARD and after 1 sec STOP. This is something a normal pilot would do via the RC radio.
I already have a arducopter APM 2.5 and an arduino mega ADK and I was thinking to connect the phone to the ADK and then the ADK to the APM to guide the copter.
I think I have 2 options: either having the ADK to generate PPM/PWM signals as a RC receiver would do or use the mavlink protocol.
Which is the best/easiest solution?
Other info:
-I have already read checked some UAV related websites, but I couldn't find something close to what I want. In most of them, try to build a new type of controller, or use only ab Android phone + ADK. I'd like to stick to something already tested and known to work (as the APM & arducopter software) and I don't want to use the phone as IMU as i don't trust its sensors
-I already have built the quad (a hexa actually)
-I have already set up the connection and protocol between the phone and the adk so i'm able to send commands like, i.e. forward, turn, hover etc...
-I have already checked the andro-copter project and similar ones.
-I might consider other platforms than the APM 2.5 if there's something easier to use
-It'd be nice to keep the RC receiver in the loop to regain control of the quad if something goes wrong.

2445,Transformation a robot in 2D?,"I'm watching this video at 36.00 min. The guy gave an example but I'm not sure what is the problem. He stated that if we want to move a robot then we should to the following 
for inhomogeneous case, 
$$
x' = Rx + t \\
R = 
\begin{bmatrix}
cos\theta & -sin\theta \\
sin\theta  & cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
$$ 
where $t$ is the translation vector and $x$ is the previous position. 
in homogeneous case, 
$$
x' = 
\begin{bmatrix}
R & \bf{t} \\
\bf{0}^{T} & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
x
$$
Now, he gave an example in which 
$$
t = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 
\end{bmatrix}
, 
x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.7 \\
0.5 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
My solution is as the following in Matlab

For homogeneous case
>> xn = [R t; 0 0 1]*[x ; 1]

xn =

    1.1414
    0.8485
    1.0000

Both have same result, but the guy got another result. What exactly he did is 
>> xf = [R x; 0 0 1]*[t ; 1]

xf =

    1.4071
    1.2071
    1.0000

Why he did switch $t$ and $x$? I'm aware of the issue that he is trying to calculate the velocity but in fact he is computing the position. This mistake in the notation won't affect the final result. 

Second question, why he assumed that the forward movement of the robot in the above example should be
$$
t = \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}
$$
? He said that because the robot always in the forward movement move in +x axis. Why this is the case? The movement in robot's frame is determined based on the direction of the robot and the distance the robot travels which is specified as hypotenuse length.

I need to transform the measurement to another coordinate frame, $G_2$. Transforming the measurement itself is trivial, but I would also need to transform its covariance, correct? The translation between $G_1$ and $G_2$ should be irrelevant, but I would still need to rotate it. If I am correct, how would I do this? For the covariances between $x$, $y$, and $z$, my first thought was to simply apply a 3D rotation matrix, but that only works for a 3x3 submatrix within the full 6x6 covariance matrix.

2597,Software libraries for parsing sensor data,"What software libraries are there for assisting the general problem of parsing a stream of sensor data?
We use various sensors like LIDARs and GPSINS units that provide messages in proprietary binary formats, and have to write drivers for each one. Even though there's a lot of similar concepts used in each sensor (like a general purpose datagram for all messages, consisting e.g. of start/end sentinels, length specifications and a checksum, and then a variety of well-defined message formats for the payload), it ends up being a lot of tedious work to develop a driver each time.
I'd love a solution where I can write out packet/message specifications in some format, and have a library that finds & extracts valid messages from a stream, and provides them in a simple data structure format.
I'm not too fussed about what language, but basically want a general purpose datagram parsing library. There's a lot of customisation with sensors, maybe some odd format parsing, and probably some initial configuration to start the data stream, so this is really something I want as a library for processing the data in real-time that can be used as part of a driver/application.
Everything I find is either too basic (the low level tools for interpreting individual elements, so still lots of time spent extracting individual elements explicitly), or too specific (i.e. parsers written specifically for one particular protocol).
As a concrete example, consider NMEA messages:

There's a basic outer datagram (starts with  followed by message name, then comma separated data, and ends with *, checksum and line terminating character)
Data is in ASCII so needs to be parsed to binary for computational use
Outer datagram allows for validation and removal of incomplete/corrupted messages
Message name & content would be further parsed for consumption
Field names can be specified for ease of use

A 'GPGLL' message might be turned from $GPGLL,4533.21,N,17739.11,W,113215.22,A*31 into a programmatic data structure containing latitude, longitude, UTC timestamp and its validity.

The LIDAR scans the hall way with a 270-degree arc and measures ranges and angles. However, so far as I know the hall way has no discernable features except when it corners
I need to find the best way to fuse the proposed action measured by the encoder with IMU and LIDAR data. It makes sense to me that I could fuse yaw from IMU with encoder data to get a better sense of heading, but how should I incorporate LIDAR data? 
In essence, what is the appropriate measurement model and how should I incorporate noise into the motion model? Beside just adding some gaussian noise at some (0,)?
Addendum
This somewhat orthogonal to the question but just as confusing to me. Currently I am using a particle filter to do SLAM, and I am a little confused about whether to represent uncertainty in angular acceleration in the particles themselves. I see two options:

A separate navigation filter using EKF (or anything really) to find a vector of ""best-estimate"" angular acceleration matrix first, then use this matrix as absolute truth for the particle filter. So that any drift in the particles is not from uncertainty in angular acceleration.
Incorporate the uncertainty into the particle drift themselves. This option appears more sensible but I am not sure what a principled way to do this is.

2649,Kinect point cloud + Pcduino. Will it work?,"I'm a newbie to Mircroprocessors (PcDuino, for example) and I wanted to know if Kinect can be integrated with the pcduino, before I go and buy the board. I know in terms of connectors etc what might be required. My concern is regarding the hardware required to run the Kinect.
To elaborate more, I'll explain my current system: I have a system working on my laptop that uses a Kinect to extract unorganized point cloud data using ""Processing"" IDE which interacts with Kinect using openni drivers. My Matlab code then processes this information to detect obstacles and specific objects (can also be done using C++). 
I want to build such a system for a robot, but using pcduino as the processing module. This means that the Kinect will connect to the pcduino using one of its usb ports. I'll power the Kinect using battery and a converted power adapter. Since pcduino can run Linux (Ubuntu) I (think I) can easily convert my laptop code into whatever the Ubuntu requires. The only concern I have is if there were any problems associated with using depth sensors with mini pc boards in terms of hardware capabilities of mini pc boards? I know that mini pc boards are not as fast as a PC, so the processing would be slower, but I'm not concerned with the speed, atleast for the time being.
One problem I encountered while using kinect, even on a PC is that the point cloud drivers in openni won't initiate the point cloud data stream, unless there was a GPU in the PC; the exact same code runs perfectly on a PC with a dedicated GPU. However, I do know that pcduino has a GPU chip (OpenGl ES2.0). Would the kinect work on this?
I searched online but the closest thing I could find is this which does not elaborate how the integration of Raspi and Asus Xtion works. I'm not too picky about the boards, anything that would work with a kinect is fine with me, although I like the pcduino since it has arduino headers and built in wi-fi etc. 
Any additional pointers can also be helpful. Please let me know if I need to elaborate on anything more.
Thanks in advance

2661,Kalman Filter when states are not observable at the same time?,"I have a system that I can make a strong kinematic model for, but my sensors send readings at unpredictable times. When I say unpredictable, I am not just saying the order the readings will arrive, I also mean that sensors are able to sleep when they do not see a significant change. When an input arrives for any given sensor, that information can be used to infer the states of many other sensors based on my model.
At first, it seemed like a Kalman Filter was exactly what I needed because I could make a prediction of all of the states of the system and then update those states when one piece of information comes in and repeat this process until a good estimate of the system as a whole was determined. However, after reading over Kalman filters, it looks like they assume that every state will be updated on a regular basis. Is there a way the Kalman filter can be modified for when you are unsure about what input will come in next and you are also unsure how much time will elasped before the next input arrives? Please note that in my case, once the information arrives, I will know the source of the input as well as the time that has elapsed since the last update, I just won't be able to predict these two things beforehand.

2668,Removing quadcopter drift to the side,"I wrote my own quadcopter firmware which is based on some older code. This code shall stabilize the copter to be always in equilibrium. The model is behaving relatively nice. I can control it with my laptop.
However I noticed, that the copter is hovering to the side (if not manually controlled), likely because of wind, not well balanced or turbulence. 
My idea was maybe to fuse GPS and accelerometer data to implement a function which shall help to hold the position. But this will likely only work if I have a hold altitude function, because changes in pitch or roll change the height, because the thrust is changed slightly. This is why I recently added a routine which shall allow to hold the altitude. 
Is someone having experiences with this? I mean with avoiding side drifts of the model because of whatever by software? The problem is in my opinion, that I don't know whether the position change is wanted (by remote control) or not. Additionally it is hard to localize the correct position and calculate the distance caused by drift from it (just with GPS, but this is not precise).

2683,Altitude hold for quadcopter with Accelerometer and Barometer,"I wonder currently how to implement an altitude control for a quadcopter. I have atm just a barometer/GPS and an accelerometer. 
Barometer and GPS are relatively straight forward implemented, but not very precise and slow. For the accelerometer readout, I remove the constant 9.81 m/s acceleration by a low pass filter. Then I take this data and calculate out of it the climb-rate(in cm per s). I know the speed approximation by this way is not so great. However I don't know a better approach so far.
For the calculation of the motor speeds I use atm two PIDs (STAB and RATE). 
I coded the example shown below, without much testing so far. I believe it will not work out in a smooth and nice way. E. g. instead of the speed calculated of the accelerometer I could use the climb-rate of the barometer. However for low altitudes and small changes I do need very likely the accelerometer. 
ArduPilot seems to use somehow in a different way both with a third PID for the acceleration. I believe they calculate the height difference like me. Then they use maybe for STAB-Pid the barometer climb rate (not like me the accelerometer) and calculate with acceleration data another output. Unfortunately I don't know how exactly, or whether there are other methods.
Does someone know the exact layout to implement with a barometer and accelerometer an altitude hold function. I mean I am really not sure whether my ideas would be correct. Maybe I can post some options later.
My PIDs:

Code for altitude hold:
// Stabilizing code done before

float fCurAlti_cm       = _HAL_BOARD.get_alti_m() * 100.f;        // Barometer and GPS data
float fAcclClimb_cms    = _HAL_BOARD.get_accel_mg_ms().z * 100;   // Accelerometer output in cm per s (gravitational const. corrected)

// calculate the difference between current altitude and altitude wanted
float fAltStabOut       = _HAL_BOARD.m_rgPIDS[PID_THR_STAB].get_pid(fCurAlti_cm - (float)(rcalt_m*100), 1);
// Rate it with climb rate (here with accelerometer)

First subsystem is composed of 3 cameras which are used for detecting markers the robot is carrying and which outputs 3 estimates of the robot's position and orientation.
The second subsystem is a system which is located on the robot and is measuring speed on the two points of the robot. By numerically integrating those two I can get an estimate on the robot's position and orientation (because I am tracking two points at once).
The first system is less accurate but the second system drifts. First system gives output about once a second while the second one gives output much more frequently (100-200 times per second).
I assume there must be a better approach than to just reset the position with the first system's estimate (as it is not 100% accurate), but to also use the accumulated position from the second sensor system and fuse that with the new data from the first system. Also, there is a question how to fuse 3 estimates of the first system? There must be a better way than pure average as it might happen that the two estimates are exactly the same and the third one is completely different (meaning that it is probably more wrong)?
Do you have any fusion algorithms to recommend to use in such a system? I know about Kalman filter, but I am having trouble figuring out how to use it as the two systems output data at different frequencies.
I hope the question is clear enough, what is the best approach to fuse the estimates into a more correct and accurate estimate?

2731,Using robotic simulator for prediction step in probabilistic localization approaches,"Probabilistic localization approaches like Kalman or Monte Carlo benefit from an accurate prediction step. The more accurate the prediction step, the more accurate is the belief of the robots pose. In most approaches probabilistic motion models are applied, mainly because robot dynamics are more difficult to model. Still some approaches rely on dynamic models in order to increase the accuracy.
Therefore, I was wondering if its reasonable to utilize a robotic simulator like V-REP or Gazebo for the prediction step. The advantages I see in doing so are the following:

the robots kinematic is solved by default, simply through modeling it in the robotic simulator
the robots dynamics are taken into account
nonlinear behaviors like slippage or collision can be modelled up to a certain extend
the robots workspace is taken into account, by modeling its environment (if the robot drives against a wall previous models would predict it behind the wall, which wont happen in a robotic simulator)

With the shown advantages I hope to achieve a more accurate prediction.
However there might be some problems using a robotic simulator. For a start it has to ensure real time behavior and there will be delay in the prediction due to the communication with the simulator.
I was looking for some papers which pick up on that idea but couldnt find any. Are there any approaches similar to my idea? If not, are there any reasons why nobody is using a robotic simulator for the prediction? What are your opinions about my proposal?

2747,Robot start-up movement problems,"I have created robot using a robot chassis kit from hobbyking. At first when testing the robot connected to USB power source and the wheels lifted above the ground everything seemed to be OK. Then, when I tried to power the robot with batteries I encountered a problem with starting the movement.
The robot hardly starts to move even when I power it with 100% of power - sometimes I have to push it a little bit in order to start driving.
As a newbie I don't know whether it is a power source (battery) or motors problem.

There are 4 motors with torque of 800gf.cm min in the chassis. 
The gear ratio is 48:1 and to power the motors 
I used two serially connected Li-ion batteries and dc-dc regulator which limits the voltage output to 5V. 
The power is regulated with dual H-bridge motor driver. 

According to specifications, the maximum free running current for a single motor is 250mA and I have read that the stall current is 3-8x running current.
Anyway, the problem is that the robot has problems with starting-up driving and I don't know how whether the motors are even powerful enough to move the robot or it is a power source problem or perhaps the obstacle could be solved with appropriate power regulation (ramp). 
How can I solve this problem?

2754,What is the Name of the part I'm describing,"I'm looking for a part that will do a particular function.  It has to be able to move along one axis and tell me the force that is being exerted on it.
Kind of how like a piston moves inside an engine (one axis of movement) except that something will be pushing at the top of the piston and I need to know how hard its pushing.  Another difference is that the piston won't be constantly moving back in forth, but needs to be able to receive commands like.   and then remain stationary at its new position.
I know to make this it would involved a sensor and something that can exert force but what is the name of the described machine?
Edit #1 - Response to Matthew Gordon
The piston would have to move between 0-6 centimeters.  The form factor would be small, ideally smaller than the palm of your hand.  (Smaller=better) The forces it would have to deal with are comparable to the forces exerted on a bicycle by its chain.  I'm a math/cs person not engineering so I don't know technical terms for these kinds of things off the top of my head.  It would have to be real time sensor reading, but the volume of data could be processed by a phone.  Would have to working in conjunction with wireless communication, probably Bluetooth, but I'd have to look into the latency requirements to be sure.

For that I try to implement the Jacobian method (with the transposed jacobian matrix) with this guide and followed the pseudocode at slide 26. But instead using the pseudoinverse of the Jacobian matrix I used the transposed one.

where $beta = 0.5$ and $epsilon = 0.0001$
Problems:
The transformation matrice should be fine, because it behaves good for the forward kinematic.
In my opinion the Jacobian matrix must be somehow wrong. I'm not sure if it is correct how I put the orientation data in the numerical calculation. For the analytical computation I didn't have any clue what could be wrong.
I would be thankful for any advice. An explicit example for calculating the Jacobian would also be very helpful.

2767,NXT Segway problem. Need advice/help,"I'm attempting to build a segway robot using a gyrosensor and accelerometer.
I'm having trouble getting the robot to remain standing, for some reason, and I can't identify the problem.
Here's what I know:
The gyroscope API for the lejos NXT platform is here:

By using timestamps and angular velocity, the project attempts to infer the angle of the robot.  The API suggests that in order to be accurate, it must be polled 100 times per second (or every 10ms on average).
The problem is that simply polling the gyrosensor takes 4ms.
Polling the accelerometer takes 10ms.
The dimensions of the robot:
Height: 28cm
wheel circumference : 13.25cm
Radius of a wheel, given the circumference:  2.1cm
The accelerometer is mounted on the top of the robot (at approximately 28cm from the ground, 26cm from axis of rotation)
In order to keep the correction amount linear (as opposed to trying to correct an arbitrary angle) , I translate the angle of the robot to a distance to travel along the ground to ""right"" the robot.  This might be a bit naive, and I'm open to suggestion here.  Basically it's just the horizontal distance calculated using a right-angle triangle with the angle of the robot at the top and hypotenuse of 28cm.
If that's not clear, it's essentially the horizontal distance from the top of the robot and the bottom of the robot.
Right now my main concern is the amount of drift the gyroscope seems to be experiencing.  Given the fact that with the NXT java software package, it's nearly impossible to poll 100 times per second, the amount of error accumulated by the gyroscope is fairly large.
Finally, I've implemented a PID control system.  The thing I'm not clear about with respect to this system is the integral and derivative of error must be calculated given a set of values.  Say, the last 20 error measurements recorded.
If the amount of past errors recorded is a variable, and the PID constants are variable, and the speed of the wheels is a variable, it seems this problem begs for some kind of automated optimization.  But how to do it?  If I set the speed to 120 RPM (roughly the max of the NXT servos) and take the past 20 errors for calculating the integral and derivative of the error, will it be possible to optimize the PID constants successfully?  Or must all 5 variables be tuned together?
Thanks ahead for any insight on the problem.

Coordinates of $P$ are relative to the state/pose of the robot (x axis looks forward the robot and y axis is positive on the right of the robot).
Suppose that the initial robot state/pose is at $S_{R}=(x_R, y_R, \theta_R)$.
The next frame (namely after $\Delta t$) with the applied control $(v, \omega)$ the robot is at state $S_{R'}=(x_{R'}, y_{R'}, \theta_{R'})$.
Where (I set the axes as OpenCV):
$x_{R'} = x_R + v cos(\theta_R) \Delta t $ 
$y_{R'} = y_R + v sin(\theta_R) \Delta t $ 
$\theta_{R'} = \theta_{R} + \omega\Delta t$
The question is: which are the coordinates $(x_P', y_P')$ of the same point $P$ relative to $S_{R'}$?

As visible in the picture, I know the transformation from the initial state to the next state of the robot and the coordinate of P in reference to the initial state

2800,PID output does not reach setpoint precisely enough,"I'm developing/tuning a software PID for a quadcopter. For now I'm only trying to stabilise the pitch angle using the front and back motors, and I'm only looking at Kp. The motors have a control resolution: input variations need to reach a threeshold to have any effect at all.
The process output does reach the setpoint, but not precisely enough for my requirements. There is no steady-state error (aka droop), the hunting range is centered on the setpoint, just too wide for my requirements. Also the instability is not an oscillation, but more of a random drift which needs to be large enough before the PID attempts to correct it.

With a lower Kp the output needs to diverge from the setpoint significantly before the error is big enough for the PID to attempt to correct it.
With a higher Kp the PID oscillates.

I could not find a reasonable compromise.
I'm thinking about applying the cuberoot function (or similar) to the error before feeding it to the PID: that way small errors should be significant enough for the PID to attempt to correct them, and large errors would be reduced and might not trigger oscillations. I suppose someone must have been through this before: is this a good solution? Are there any better alternatives?
This is not a steady-state error (aka droop) or oscillation issue as far as I can tell: please don't suggest using Ki or Kd
EDIT: I have clarified the problem description and suggested using cuberoot rather than logarithm which was a bad idea indeed.

This graph shows how the fill rate part of the state vector changes over the course of 1000 iterations of the simulation.
Adjusting the Measurement Variance Matrix seems to have very little effect on the fill rate noise.
Also, the Kalman gain vector and State Variance matrix seem to be constant throughout the simulation. I assumed that the State Variance would reduce as the filter became more and more confident in its state estimate.

When I originally said ""I have not build this"" I meant that the robot is in what could be called a ""design phase"". For the sake of my question lets assume for a moment that the whole robot consists of just one IMU sensor. It moves magically (no motors that create a lot of noise in the sensor measurements). With theoretical I mean I am interested in the mathematics and algorithms involved in solving this problem. What I call IMU sensor provides raw accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer measurements.
Lets say our tiny robot travels on a snooker table (3569 mm x 1778 mm). I believe this is sufficiently small to call it 2d. Now, sensor fusion should be much easier (faster, consume less resources) than in 3d, right? 
I would like to measure the velocity and if possible the position. 
With velocity I mean at a given point of time I need to know the current velocity of the robot moving over the snooker table. Velocity is in the range of 0 - 5 m/s.
With position I mean at a given point of time I need to know the current position of the robot on the snooker table (x, y, heading).
I hope this will be possible since the robot should be able to identify some landmarks and use this information to reduce position errors.
When I originally said ""I hope this will be possible"" I meant to express that I already am aware of the fact that real sensor data is noisy and errors accumulate quickly. Using landmarks I will / or will not be able to manage to reduce the error in the position estimates. But this is NOT part of my question.
I am about to improve my linear algebra knowledge. So I am confident to manage some matrix multiplications, inversions and such.
My question is for some ideas, references on measuring velocity and position in 2d using an IMU sensor like this one.

2849,Our quadcopter goes forward instead of hovering in place. How to correct it?,"I'm trying to do a quadcopter with some friends and we have a problem. It goes forward instead of hovering in place. We made a video to explain it, you can see it here.
As you can see, the quadcopter flight and go forward when I don't touch the controller. I need to correct it to go backward and it goes forward again.
We use the kk2.1.5. 

The HobbyKing KK2.1.5 Multi-Rotor controller is a flight control board for multi-rotor aircraft (Tricopters, Quadcopters, Hexcopters etc). Its purpose is to stabilize the aircraft during flight. To do this it takes the signal from the 6050MPU gyro/acc (roll, pitch and yaw) then passes the signal to the Atmega644PA IC. The Atmega644PA IC unit then processes these signals according the users selected firmware and passes control signals to the installed Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs). These signals instruct the ESCs to make fine adjustments to the motors rotational speed which in turn stabilizes your multi-rotor craft.

We made some test. As you can see in the video, we placed the battery backward to be sure there is no weight against. When we check values in the debug mode, all values are at 0 when nothing is pressed.

2865,Simplest way to do object tracking with a 2D range finder sensor?,"My current class assignment is to program a robot through a course that includes two moving obstacles  other robots moving at constant speed around a region the one robot must get to. Since the other robots are moving at a constant pace alongside a predictable path, my robot can just stop at the border of the region, wait until the others pass by and then proceed. The robot can use a 2D laser range scanner to sense its surroundings.
Given these restrictions, what is the simplest object tracking algorithm I could use? I am thinking of something along these lines:

Collect two laser readings (2D point clouds)  and B with a suitable time gap between them;
Apply DBSCAN to A and B, producing the cluster lists A' and B'; 
Generate a list P of pair-wise matches of the clusters in A' and B', maybe using the Hungarian algorithm;
Discard from P any pairings whose difference falls within a threshold;
Calculate direction and magnitude of movements from the distance between the centers of mass of each cluster pair.

The reason for choosing DBSCAN and the Hungarian algorithm is that I already have both implemented and in use elsewhere; and the difference between clusters could be measured as the distance between their centers of mass.
Do you think this solution would work for my problem? Do you have any suggestions on better and/or simpler ways to solve it?

When moving, distances are random variables from the following distributions: $d_L \sim t_{L}s_{L}N(1, \sigma_L^2)$ and $d_R \sim t_{R}s_{R}N(1, \sigma_R^2)$. Later this model might expand a little bit.

x2 12V 146Rpm DC motor with two phase hall encoder
x7 Sharp 2Y0A21 IR sensors
x6 URM37 ultrasonic sensor
x4 IR ground sensor

Right now I'm only using a RoMeo board (arduino 328 compatible) to drive the motors and process the PIDs for the wheels + steering and also access to all the sensors (except for the kinect). I have a BeagleBone Black running linux that is intended to be the main brain connected to the RoMeo using the RS232 port and do the processing of the Kinect + wifi access.
I started thinking about connecting the sensors to the Beagle board directly so I don't need to waste time sending commands to the arduino board to read the sensors and that yielded the first issue, beagle board works on 3.3V instead of 5V used on the sensors. 
After this I thought to create a board with voltage divisors to connect the sensors there and then using a ribbon cable to connect this new board to the beaglebone. I couldn't find any 2x23 IDC male connector to create the ""interface cable"" between the two boards so the beaglebone option is out as I don't want to have tons of jumper cables all over the place.
This morning I thought about all this again and I researched about GPIO boards over USB and found three from Numato, only one works on TTL 5V and has 8 pins so I would need a few of them to use all the sensors so unless I design my own board this option is out too.
At this point I'm quite confused in terms of what's the best hardware I could use to drive this beast. Right now I think I should use a Intel NUC with linux for the Kinect, wifi and usb link to a custom made sensor board. This custom made board will work on TTL 5V, provide a power bus for the sensors and will interface all the ""low level"" sensors using USB as link. I also thought about an FPGA for the custom board but I'm not sure if this would help me or if it's worth the effort of learning how to use it.

2876,Why linkage-based haptic devices are much more common than cable (tension)-based ones?,"According not only to this link, but in my humble opinion to common sense as well, cable-based haptic devices have got lower inertia and are less complicated mechanically. I also believe that controlling them is not that big deal - the inverse kinematics should be quite straightforward. Moreover, the play should be easy to compensate - if there occurs any at all, since the cables are tensioned. Cables should also be easy - ? just a guess from me - to be equipped with strain gauges or to become strain gauges themselves, allowing to enhance control capabilities of a device.
Where am I wrong? Why is that the links-based systems (e.g. PhaNTom or Falcon, although that latter has got cable transmission), especially with impedance control, are the only I seem to be able to buy? Is it because of cable elongation (creep)? Or too constrained workspace (esp. angles)?

EDIT:
For everybody interested, i found a solution to this problem in Introduction to Robotics - Third Edition by John J. Craig on Page 175-176. It is done with the aid of the iterative Newton-Euler dynamics algorithm. The actual trick is, to set all velocities and accelerations to zero except for the base acceleration. The base acceleration will be $^0 \dot v_0 = G$, where G has the magnitude of the gravity vector but points in opposite direction. This is equivalent to saying that the base of the robot is accelerating upwards with 1 g and this upward acceleration causes exactly the same effect on the link as gravity would.

This works, but the problem is that Arduino's analogWrite function accepts a value of 0 - 255 to represent the duty cycle of the PWM which isn't precise enough. A value of 1 yields around 20 millivolts and a value of 2 yields around 40 millivolts.

I'm creating mannequin robots that require 24 motors: 2 neck, 4 shoulder, 2 elbow, 4 wrist, 2 waist, 4 hip, 2 knee and 4 ankle motors. The mannequins will be bolted via a horizontal post from the lower back to a wall. This means they can run, dance, and pose. I may also do something with the horizontal beam so the robots can do side flips, and moves like the twist, jumps and crouches. They will not stand up, but be bolted as I've described to a wall. They could even spin around completely to face the wall.
I've tried using 6v hobby servos for the joins. These are too weak for lifting fibreglass mannequin body parts. They are too loud. They also make noise when poses are held, and they drop and smash when power is shut off. I have been using a handheld remote control for testing with only 5 channels. The robot must be programmable though. Lets say the objective is to make a mannequin dance to 'Thriller' like Michael Jackson. 
I am open to using kinnect technology as the controller (so that a dancer can simply dance in front of my robot, who can copy and remember) but I'm also open to controllers that allow me to force the mannequin into a pose at specific time codes in the song. If necessary, I am also willing to program the poses using some kind of lighting desk type controller (such as tech crews use in rock concerts to sync everything to go with the music).
I have noticed that a power drill or winch is very loud whereas my fan is very quiet. I live in an apartment in which neighbours can hear footsteps from other apartments. I would not dare turn on a drill at 4am because it would wake up everyone in the whole building, but I would have no guilt in turning on a fan. I need my robot to be as quiet as a fan. The voltage does not really matter for this project. I'm happy to use up to 240v from the wall socket.
Please let me know which motors and controllers are best for my mannequin robots, taking cost into account. Thanks so much for any help :)

If this requirement is unclear, imagine that I have to map a dot representing my robot position to an image of the current floor from the top.
My original idea was to use GPS, however as I need submeter accuracy that would be incredibly expensive.  I also considered Monti-Carlo localization, however that requires no obstruction between sonar sensors and walls.  It is also a significant task programically.

Only one that occupies a central position, corresponding to the motor, should rotate. The discs are mounted in rectangular frame that can be slid to bring the required disc to the central position.
Can anyone suggest a method to achieve this? (Basically coupling and uncoupling the motor shaft from whatever disc is in the centre.)

2961,McKibben artificial muscles and the 400:1 ratio,"I was recently reading that those artificial muscles had the highest power/weight ratio while electric motors only have a ratio of less than 100:1. As electrical engineer I have never worked with pneumatics before and do not have a big idea about air pumps.
My question is, how much will this ratio change if we consider an autonomous system. 
On one side, the McKibben actuators + air pumps and valves + energy source   and on the other side, electric motors + energy source. As an example, let suppose that somebody found a way to model and control the artificial muscles as good as the electric motors and make two autonomous walking leg models, which one would have a higher resulting power/weight ratio ?

2964,Quadcopter PID output,"I'm trying to develop a control system to a quadcopter and one of my options is to use a PID controller (which I think is the most used method).
From what I've read, the commom strategy is to run a PID algorithm to each axis. My question is: how the PID output is converted to PWM signals?
I'm asking that because the three axes and the four rotors depend on each other. I mean, if I slow down a couple of rotors which are opposite to each other then the quadcopter will move down in a vertical axis. But if I speed one of them and slow down the other, the quadcopter will rotate in a different axis.
So we cannot isolate each axis and associate them with a single rotor or a pair of those. And because of that, how can a PID output (which is associated to an axis) can be converted to PWM signals to the rotors?
Is that a MIMO system?

Is there a simple mechanical mechanism I can attach to a fixture and insert into or around the pipe that lets me control how easy or difficult it is to rotate? 
I am thinking of something like a drill bit chuck that fits inside the pipe and expands or a circular clutch that clamps down around pipe to add resistance when one tightens a thumbscrew.

2976,Selecting Precise High Torque Motor and Motor Controller for use with Arduino Mega 2560 R3,"My current project calls for 6 motors (50 mechanical watts), and an assortment of sensors.  I selected the Arduino Mega 2560 R3 to use as the basis for the project.  I am having trouble determining the best motors and motor controllers for the project.
The motors need to be very precise and very controllable, meaning I need to make very small changes to the speed of the motor several times a second.  The motors will follow a position vs. time curve.  I broke up the position vs time graph into 100 hundred sections.  I found the acceleration(degrees per second^2) of each section, and I want to put it in to the array and format it as such: 
float arr[] = {position 1, acceleration between position 1 and 2, position 2, acceleration between position 2 and 3, position 3, etc...}
Here is an idea of how I plan to program the motor:

I am planning to run the motors in a PID loop so it will not be as cut and dry as the loop above.  
I saw the spark fun AutoDriver stepper motor controller, I thought the accompanying library would save me a lot of work. I very quickly noticed that it had some major limitations.  First it did not allow me to very the acceleration while the motor was running, for example: if I call:
             kneeMotorDriver.run(FWD, 2000);

I have to call softStop() or hardStop() otherwise the AutoDriver will keep telling me its busy, my interpretation (please correct me if I am wrong) is I cannot change any of the drive commands (i.e.) I cannot vary the acceleration.  The AutoDriver does have other functions but they require a target step, I do not want to give a target step because I don't want to be limited by the steps (1.8 degrees on the stepper I have) I may want to stop at 34.6 degrees, but with the Auto Driver I cannot.  
The auto driver is also limited by its 3A per phase current limit.
Just to summarize:
I need a Mega to control 6 motors with a minimum output of 50 mechanical watts, I need very precise control, I am planning on using a potentiometer or rotary encoder.  The motors will run in a PID loop with several sensors.  I need to be able to vary the speed several times a second.
All 6 motors will be executing different motions and they need to be able to run very consistent over time, (i.e) when motor 1 is at 2 degrees motor 2 must be at 18 degrees.
I am still open to the idea of a stepper motor I can live with having to stop on a step but I would really prefer not too.
Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

2982,Performance/memory considerations for pathfinding lookup tables on RobotC for a small set of paths,"I'm writing a C code generator geared toward RobotC and complex tasks for an FTC team, and was wondering about some performance and storage concerns:

How much memory is available for my program's data? It'll be mostly pre-defined lookup tables, generally in the form of multidimensional arrays.
How much NXT memory is available for my program itself? As in, roughly how much code can I expect to fit into a single RobotC compiled program?
How quickly do programs execute, generally? Looking at disassembly most of my generated lines correspond to 2-4 opcodes.

Based on these, I'm trying to make a decision of precomputation vs runtime pathfinding.
I'm using NXT/Tetrix. My major interest at this point with these questions is for pathfinding. I plan to have a 64x64 grid and be running Djisktra's A* algorithm with a heuristic function that assigns a penalty to turns and is as close to consistent as possible (not sure if consistency/monotonicity is doable with the turn penalty).
Roughly 8 paths would be cached if I decide to use the pre-cached lookup tables.
Instead of a set, I'll probably use a boolean array for the set of nodes visited. The fact that I'm working with a square layout will allow me to use a 2D array for the map needed to reconstruct the path.
I'd love some feedback and answers to my question if anyone has any. Thanks!

2987,Can I reuse the hall sensors in a brushless motor as an encoder?,"I have upgraded the motors in my robotic arm to sensored, brushless RC car motors. The hope was to reuse the Hall sensors to double as a rotary encoder, by tapping 2 Hall sensors and treating the 2 bits as a quadrature signal (a crude quadrature since 2 of the 4 states will be longer than the other 2).
This works when none of the motor phases are powered and I just rotate the motor manually. But once the stator coils are energized, the encoder no longer counts correctly: When running at low power, the counting is correct, but when running under high power, the count is monotonic (only increases or decreases) no matter if I run in reverse or forward.
I'm almost certain this is because of the stator coils overpowering the permanent magnets on the rotors. So is there still a way to use the Hall sensors as an encoder?
Sorry if this is an obvious question. I'd love to research this problem more if I had more time.
Update:
I've measured the wave forms with my DSO quad and see the expected 120 degree separated signals (the measurement for phase C gets more inaccurate over time because I only had 2 probes, so I measured phases A & B first, then A & C, and then merged them.
When ESC speed is 0.1:

When ESC speed is 0.3:

Previously, I was using a hardware quadrature counter (EQEP module on a BeagleBone). At speed=0.3, this was counting backwards no matter if I do forward or reverse!
I then implemented quadrature counting on an LPC1114FN28 uController. The result was still bad at high speeds (count didn't change at all). The logic was:

Then I got the idea to change the code to not update prevState until an expected state happens (to deal with glitches):
  int state = phaseA | (phaseB * 2)
  if (prevState != -1)
  {
    if (allowableTransitions[prevState][0] == state)
    {
       ++rotations;
       prevState = state;
    }
    else if (allowableTransitions[prevState][1] == state)
    {
      --rotations;
      prevState = state;
    }
    else
    {
        // assume transition was a glitch
    }
  }
  else
    prevState = state;

Now the counting finally is correct in both directions, even at speeds higher than 0.3!
But are there really glitches causing this? I don't see any in the waveforms?

Or we just compare each observation with each predicted measurement?, so in this case we have one loop. I assume the sensor can give all observations for all landmarks every scan.  The following picture depicts the scenario. Now every time I execute the EKF-Localization I get $z^{i} = \{ z^{1}, z^{2}, z^{3}, z^{4}\}$ and I have $m$, so I can get $\hat{z}^{i} = \{ \hat{z}^{1}, \hat{z}^{2}, \hat{z}^{3}, \hat{z}^{4}\}$.

This means that between the flight controller (I use 3DR APM2.6 or Pixhawk) and the motors there are heavy duty power wires as well as a servo-style cable carrying a PWM control signal for the ESC. Three short heavy-duty wires then connect the motor to the ESC, one for each phase.
Several times I've heard or read people saying that the electronic speed controllers (ESCs) should be mounted far away from the flight controller (FMU seems to be the abbreviation en vogue) and close to the motors. I think the idea is that this cuts down on interference (I'm not sure what sort) that could be emitted by the long ESC -> motor wires that would be required if you have the ESCs all at the center of the aircraft. Another consideration is that ESCs can be cooled by propellers if they are right under the rotor wash, as mine usually are.
So, I've always mounted ESCs close to motors, but realized that design could be much simpler if ESCs are mounted centrally. So, my question is: what are the pros and cons of mounting ESCs close to the motor versus close to the FMU?

3040,"""Smooth"" inverse kinematics model for 2-wheeled differential drive robot","I have been reading about kinematic models for nonholonomic mobile robots such as differential wheeled robots. The texts I've found so far all give reasonably decent solutions for the forward kinematics problem; but when it comes to inverse kinematics, they weasel out of the question by arguing that for every possible destination pose there are either infinite solutions, or in cases such as $[0 \quad 1 \quad 0]^T$ (since the robot can't move sideways) none at all. Then they advocate a method for driving the robot based on a sequence of straight forward motions alternated with in-place turns.
I find this solution hardly satisfactory. It seems inefficient and inelegant to cause the robot to do a full-stop at every turning point, when a smooth turning would be just as feasible. Also the assertion that some points are ""unreachable"" seems misleading; maybe there are poses a nonholonomic mobile robot can't reach by maintaining a single set of parameters for a finite time, but clearly, if we vary the parameters over time according to some procedure, and in the absence of obstacles, it should be able to reach any possible pose.
So my question is: what is the inverse kinematics model for a 2-wheeled differential drive robot with shaft half-length $l$, two wheels of equal radii $r$ with adjustable velocities $v_L \ge 0$ and $v_R \ge 0$ (i.e. no in-place turns), and given that we want to minimize the number of changes to the velocities?

Use interrupts ( library) instead of pulseIn

3063,Why should I still use EKF instead of UKF?,"The Unscented Kalman Filter is a variant of the Extended Kalman Filter which uses a different linearization relying on transforming a set of ""Sigma Points"" instead of first-order Taylor series expansion.
The UKF does not require computing Jacobians, can be used with discontinuous transformation, and is, most importantly, more accurate than EKF for highly nonlinear transformations.
The only disadvantage I found is that ""the EKF is often slightly faster than the UKF"" (Probablistic Robotics). This seems negligible to me and their asymptotic complexity seems to be the same.
So why does everybody still seem to prefer EKF over UKF? Did I miss a big disadvantage of UKF?

3069,Quadcopter degrees of freedom,"It might be kind of a stupid question but how many degrees of freedom are there in a typical quadcopter? I say some saying 4 and some saying 6. The difference stands in translation throughout the other 2 axis (horizontal ones). Being strict to what you can directly tell the quadcopter to do, only 4 movements are possible since you cannot apply a pure lateral force. But you can tilt to start a lateral movement and align the body right after and let it hover in a horizontal axis, theoretically. So, formally, how many degrees of freedom should I consider to exist?

3071,Mahalanobis distance between 2 line features,"I am implementing the ATLAS SLAM framework for a ground robot, using EKF Slam for local maps and using line segment features. The line segment features can be abstracted to their respective lines  where d and  represent the distance and angle in the distance-angle representation of lines. 
In the given framework, there is a local map matching step where lines of the local maps will be matched, and there is a need for a distance metric between 2 lines. The mahalanobis distance is suggested in the literature, however strictly a mahalanobis distance is between a single measurement and a distribution and not between 2 distributions.
How do I find the mahalanobis distance between line 1 [d1,1] with covariance matrix S1 and line 2 [d2,2] with covariance matrix S2?
In the EKF Algorithm from the book Probabilistic Robotics by Sebastian Thrun, there is a computation during the feature update step, where it looks like the covariances (of a new measurement and an existing measurement) are multiplied to give a resultant covariance matrix, and then the inverse is used in the Mahalanobis distance computation. 
That would be similar to 
Mahalanobis_Distance = [d2-d1,2-1] * Inverse(S1*S2) * [d2-d1,2-1]'

Is that correct?

Fused sensor nodes and actuator nodes with handler

Single sensor and actuator nodes with handler

For me i guess the best is to have some kind of handler, which handles the communication between sensors and actuators and have one node for each element of the Robot (like in Fig.2). Because like that the system loosely coupled and can be extended easily, but I want to know what your opinion is.

Logic behind the question is, 
In case of pure resistance heater, PWM duty cycle percentage directly relates to power (on off time ratio). So, direct control is appropriate.
However, motor has two additional effects,
a) with considerable inductance, initial current is smaller and ramping up over time
b) as RPM gradually ramping up, after time constant of mechanical inertia etc, increasing back EMF will reduce current
Will it be wise to ignore the above two effects and still expect a reasonably good outcome?

For the software part, we have programming by touch, by which human can drag the robot and record the desired pose. Besides, we have PCL object recognition that can recognize the object and its pose in the scene. Lastly, we have online trajectory generator and dynamic obstacle avoidance that can improve the safety when the robot corporates with human.

The gantry will move from home position to the right (outbound) at 1m/s. The mass of the gantry will vary from 3Kg to 6Kg. On the return home (inbound) one must avoid spillage of contents which may require soft start/stop or simply a slow return to home.
In the outbound case, what I'd like to know is how,in a practical sense, do you brake the mass and bring the gantry to a stop, ensuring that the gantry plate always comes to rest to within 0.5mm of an end plate?
I'm clearer how I can ensure the gantry stops to within 0.5mm of the home position, because I can use a PWM ramp to slowly decelerate.
I'm wanting to avoid using an MCU. Just want to use an IC with switches and potentiometers.
You can also use math if you want to explain.
Of course, one seeks to begin to arrest the mass as close to the end stop in the outbound case as one can without problems.

But apparently something's amiss since the create base chirps and then powers down after showing [kinect_breaker_enabler-5] process has finished cleanly as output and the log file location (see output below), but I dont see a prompt. I checked the battery and that's charged so that's not the problem. Following is the terminal output.

3170,Path comparison,"Problem: the cartesian position of an end effector (no orientation) of a robot arm is recorded, say, every millisecond (the time steps can not be changed), during a motion. The robot arm is commanded the same path but with different velocities. So I get different trajectories. I want to calculate the deviation of the paths, which is the distances of equivalent points of two paths. The problem is to find equivalent points. Since the two velocities are different the comparison at the same time steps of the trajectories makes no sense. I can assume that the paths underlying the trajectories to be compared are rather similar. The deviation for the ideal path being smaller than 1% of a typical length dimension of the path. I want to detect deviations of much lass than that. 
I have to map the timestamp of the recorded points to the path length, and make comparison of points at the same path length. But of course also the path lengths differ for different paths, so any deviation would distort the result for all later points. How can I compensate for this ? 
Is there a reliable algorithm ? Where can I find information ?

3178,Controlling a system with PID that resists backdrive,"I'm controlling the angular position of a pendulum using a DC motor with a worm gearbox. Mechanically, worm gears are impossible to backdrive.
Using a PID controller on a pendulum system with a regular DC motor (no worm gear), the integrator would help the motor find the appropriate constant power setting to overcome gravity so the pendulum can hold any arbitrary position. With the worm gear, however, there is no need to apply constant power to the motor once the desired position is achieved. Power to the motor can be cut off and the worm gear will resist gravity's force to backdrive the pendulum to the lowest gravity potential.
It seems to me, then, that the integrator of the PID algorithm will cause large overshoots once the desired position is achieved. I want the integrator initially to help control the pendulum to the desired position. But once the position is achieved, I'd need the integrator to turn off.
The only solution I can come up with is to test for a special condition in the PID algorithm that checks if the position has been reached AND the angular speed is small, then instantaneously reset the integrator to zero. Is there a better way to handle the integrator in a system that resists backdrive?
** EDIT *
When I originally worded my question, I was mostly just interested in the academic approach of backdrive resistance in a PID loop. But it'll help if I explain the actual mechanism I'm building. The device is a robotic arm that rotates on a car window motor. It will also occasionally pick up and drop small weights at the end of the arm. Manufacturing variability in motors and the difference in drive torque when picking up the small weights led to me consider a PID loop.

Each one has their obvious pros and cons but correct me if i am wrong, i believe the rack and pinion system is the most sturdy and easiest to put together.
I googled for Rack and pinion but all i get is industrial websites. Is there any place that sells cheaper rack and pinion sets for hobbyists? The payload of the XY Table is an eletro-magnet that isn't extremely heavy (maybe a half kilogram at most).
So obviously the motor must be strong enough to move anothe rack which will be significantly heavier than the payload.

3206,Current-limiting stepper motors for RepRap,"I have been working on a robot project for a while. Now I am tired of finding parts that just does the job, so it is time to do create parts.
A 3D printer will do the trick for many parts, but 3D printers share a lot with a CNC mill in terms of control and parts. So my question is this:
I am building a Reprap style printer, but I will use more heavy duty parts and motors, hoping to make a aluminum capable 3 axis mill later. I found some bipolar NEMA 23 stepper motors at 1.9 Nm and 3 Amps per coil. According to the reprap.org website, they recommend NEMA 17 and low voltage. Seems to me that they use voltage to limit the current.
Can I build a reprap, and use current limiting stepper drivers with an Arduino and some software I find online, and get away with these large stepper motors? Or am I in for a lot of trouble?

3207,Best microphone for speech recognition tasks,"I made several tests with different setups in order to achieve an acceptable speech recognition quality. It works well when I push a button to activate it but now I want it to be automatically activated when a user speaks. This is a big problem, especially when I only use the energy of the audio signal to guess when the user is speaking. That is why I thought about using a headset and not a distant microphone. In a headset the microphone is very close to the users mouth and it is easier to make correct guesses about when the user is speaking. Now my question is if bluetooth sets used with mobile phones also have such a property. They are not long enough and their microphone is not positioned exactly in front of the mouth. Is there a possibility that such devices can also capture some speech/noise from a distant user? Is there a significant difference in the signal energy coming from the user's speech and a 1 meter distant person's speech?

3208,Electronic Speed Control Concepts,"I am a programmer who has never worked with electronics before. I am learning the concepts and hoping to build a quadcopter, with the control software entirely written by me. Motor control seems to be the most important part.
Is it true that the typical brushless DC motor and ESC (Electronic Speed Control) can only approximately control the speed?  That's because the ESC seems to have only a very approximate idea how fast the motor is revolving. This still works for a PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) controller because it gets indirect feedback from say a gyroscope whether the motor is going fast enough and so it can tell the ESC to make it revolve ""even faster"" or ""even slower"", and that's good enough.
Is my understanding in the above paragraph correct?
If so, I wonder whether a servo motor that can inform about its current rate of rotation could help do away with the ESC entirely? I feel that if the microcontroller can receive an input about motor speeds and send an output requesting a certain speed, it would not need the ESC. But I am not sure how servo motors work -- what happens immediately after you request 100rpm when say they were at 80rpm?
Since they cannot adjust the immediately, should the microcontroller immediately adjust other motors to account for the fact that not all motors are at 100rpm yet?  Does that imply that the microcontroller should only request very small deltas from the currently measured speed, so that the period of deviation from desired state is negligible?
In the latter model, of requesting only very small deltas from currently measured speed, the algorithm seems like it would not really be PID since there is no way to control the acceleration? But may be requesting the servo to go from 80rpm to 100rpm causes it to reach 81rpm much faster than requesting it to go from 80rpm to 81rpm?
I feel I know so little I cannot put my finger on it more precisely, but I hope this gives an idea of the concepts I am struggling to absorb.
To summarize, the questions are:

can a servo (brushless dc) motor allow doing away with ESC?
does a servo motor accept control inputs such as ""revolve at 100rpm""?
does a servo motor offer an output saying ""i am at 80rpm now""?
does a servo motor at 80rpm go to 81rpm faster if it is requested to revolve at 100rpm versus at 81rpm?

The goal is to match the relative movements of the components on screen to the real-world counterpart. For example, a absolute rotary encoder records the current angle of a physical joint and the virtual joint is rotated to match. Is this feasible?

3218,Repairing non-lubricated linear actuator,"I have a Chinese CNC mill (CNC3020T, though several different devices go under this name), and its Z axis was very imprecise, often being randomly off position by as much as 0.5mm. I've disassembled the linear actuator and discovered several problems with it.
First problem is that they apparently forgot to lubricate the linear ball bearings. I make this conclusion because the rails have a set of grooves ground into them, and after wiping the rails with a tissue the only thing that is left is the finely powdered metal, with no traces of oil or other lubricant.


Second problem is the nut. I expected to see a ballnut, but in reality it is just a piece of threaded PTFE! The leadscrew rotates smoothly in it, but there is quite some lateral movement, i.e. I can tilt it slightly without any opposing force.

Third problem is the overall mounting. In the picture below, the top left screw has been sheared in the factory and then they hid their mistake by tapping a larger thread and putting in a shorter screw that doesn't actually hold anything in the top plate.  So the whole assembly was fixed in three, rather than four, points. However, the remaining screw was quite tight.

So my closely related questions are:

Is the assembly even salvageable? How do I verify that linear ball bearings, the PTFE nut are relatively undamaged?
Can I just rotate the rails by 45 to get smooth surface again?
What do I lubricate the linear bearings with? Do I clean them before lubrication? I have an ultrasonic cleaner.
Any other advice on maintenance of the whole assembly? There may be something that I missed.

Although we can track the motion, using Kalman filter, That is only applicable when we want to predict the new future(As far as I'm considered). But I need to predict the ultimate goal of a moving object.
To better express the problem let see the following example:

3227,Finding a Hydraulic Actuator to be controlled through a MCU,"I'm researching potential actuators I can use on a project i'm doing. I'm designing a creeper (platform for rolling under vehicles) that can lift you up just like the operation of those hospital beds. The creeper will have a joystick that will control up and down motion as well as the option to drive it forward,backwards,left and right.
I need an actuator that will support an average weight of 250lbs that would be able to lift a body of that weight. I was thinking of a hydraulic actuator but i'm not sure if these exist. I can very well have two actuators to share the load also. However, I need to control these actuators through a micro-controller unit. I'm planning on using a Raspberry Pi because I have an abundance of them mainly, but i'll be researching other potential units. 
Therefore, my MAIN question is where can I find an actuator that would be a good fit for this type of project that can be integrated with a micro-controller unit? Does anyone have experience with this type of project or any important details I need to take into consideration that I'm not thinking of?

3231,Up to what force is a servo motor a reasonable choice as an actuator?,"I'm working on an application where I need to apply a linear or angular force to operate a linkage mechanism, but I don't (yet) know what amount of force I will need. I anticipate that it will be less than 4.5 kg (44 N). The travel distance on the linkage input should be less than 15 cm.
As I look through available servos, they seem to exist firmly in the scale-model realm of remote control vehicles, and as such I am uncertain if any will be suitable for my application. For example, one of Futaba's digital servos, the mega-high torque S9152, is listed at 20 kg/cm.
From what I understand, this means that at 1 cm from the center of the servo shaft, I can expect approximately 20 kg force. If I wanted 15 cm of travel distance I would need roughly a 10.6 cm radius, which would diminish the applied force to 20 / 10.6 = 1.9 kg, well below the 4.5 that might be required.
Question:
Is my understanding and calculation even remotely accurate? Should I be looking at other types of actuators instead of servos? They seem to become prohibitively expensive above 20 kg/cm torque. (For the purposes of this project, the budget for the actuator is less than $250 US.)
For my application, I'd like to have reasonable control over intermediate positions across the travel range, good holding power, and fairly fast operation. For this reason I have dismissed the idea of using a linear actuator driven by a gearmotor and worm drive.
I am relatively new to robotics in the usage of motorized actuators, but I've used pneumatic cylinders for many years. For this application, I can't use pneumatics.
Edit:
Per comments, some additional constraints that are important:

Linkage Details: The linkage is a planar, one degree-of-freedom, part of a portable system (similar to a scissor lift mechanism). It is for a theatrical effect where the motion is amplified and force reduced (speed ratio and mechanical advantage are < 1).
Power: It will be carried by a person. As such, the actuation needs to be battery-operated, as no tubing or wiring can tether the person. Tubing or wiring that is self-contained is okay. Because this is a portable system, battery-power will be used. The control system will be designed specifically for an appropriate actuator. Rechargeable batteries up to 12V will most likely be employed. Actuators could operate on as high as 24V. Ideally a motor would not exceed 1-2 amperes draw, but as it is not in continuous operation, this is not a hard limit.
Not Pneumatic: I've considered pneumatic actuation, using CO2 cartridges, for example, but the client would prefer not to use pneumatics. Also, the ability to stop/hold at intermediate points in the motion range is desirable, and somewhat more complicated to do with pneumatic actuators.
Speed: An ideal actuator will be able to move the input coupling 15 cm in 1-2 seconds.
Weight: Weight constraints are not well-defined. As it will be carried by a person, it should be moderately lightweight. The actuator itself should probably be less than 1kg, but certainly this can vary. (The rest of the mechanism will probably be 6-8 kg.)
Size: The primary size constraint is that everything must fit within a space measuring no more than 500 x 500 x 120 mm (H x W x D). The linkage mechanism extends from and collapses outside the enclosure, parallel to the width.
Noise: The quieter the better, but noise is the least priority.

Servos seemed like the best choice for the job, but they don't seem to be available with the sort of torque I need.

4256,IMU based acceleration parameters for differential drive robot,"I have a differential drive robot whose motors are virtually quiet while driving on a completely flat surface, but the motors make a lot of noise when on a incline. This is likely due to the correction required to maintain speed with the high inertial load where the robot cannot accelerate fast enough for the PID to keep up.
But I noticed that some of the noise is related to acceleration, and the higher the acceleration, the smaller the amount of noise I hear, or the smaller the time the same level of noise lasts (up to a certain acceleration limit, otherwise the motors get really noisy again).
I am trying to find out of how to use an IMU that I have a available in order to change the acceleration based on how steep the path's incline is.

4288,Tilt-compensated compass - at my wits' end,"I'm a bit at my wits' end here - I'm trying to build a tilt compensated compass for my autonomous sailboat (ardusailor!). I'm using an InvenSense MPU9150. Originally, I used the built-in fusion support on the sensor to get a quaternion, pull the yaw/pitch/roll angles from that, and then use this formula to do the tilt compensation:

where the various s_angle is sin(angle) and c_angle is cos(angle). That didn't work. I tried using a vector-based approach stolen from here. That didn't work. Then, I took away the tilt compensation, and just did an uncompensated atan2(Yh,Xh), and that produced very strange result as well. 
Basically, as I rotate the sensor about the z axis, the value rotates between 70 and -10 degrees, completing a full circle (i.e. as i make a 360 degree rotation, it starts at 70, gets to -10, and then back up to 70). 70 is at about 0* magnetic, 10 is at about 180, 0 is at about 70-80.
I see the same behavior from an HMC5883L magnetometer chip as well. The thing is, looking at raw values, I get magnetic values that seem fine, and hard and soft iron offsets are in place:

top row is corrected for offsets (using an ellipsoid fit method), bottom is raw. The numbers may look skewed, but they aren't - the scales aren't all the same. Graphs are, in order, x:y, y:z, x:z

4295,EKF Localization when robot is in parallel with a landmark.,"I'm facing a real weird problem with EKF Localization. The filer gives me wrong error every time the robot is in parallel with a landmark. I've debugged the code many times but failed to solve the problem however I found out where is exactly the problem occurs. The following picture shows the scenario. The robot moves in a circular motion. There are four landmarks. I have indicted in the picture where the filer gives me wrong angle for the estimated state.  As you see, when the robot is in parallel with all landmarks, I got a wrong angle for the estimated robot's pose. 

This is another picture shows how the estimated angle is wrong where the red circle is the estimated robot's pose and the blue one is the actual robot's pose. 

I did also track the problem numerically. What I found out is that the estimated measurement of landmark # 4 is in the opposite direction of the actual measurement of landmark # 4. 

and this is how I computed the angles. 
For the actual measurements,
Zobs = [          sqrt((map(i,1) - real_robot(1))^2 + (map(i,2) - real_robot(2))^2)        ;
            atan2(map(i,2) - real_robot(2), map(i,1) - real_robot(1)) - real_robot(3);

     Zobs(2) = Zobs(2) + sigma_phi*randn();
     Zobs(3) = i;
 Zobs(2) = mod(Zobs(2), 2*pi);

 if (Zobs(2) > pi) % was positive
    Zobs(2) = Zobs(2) - 2*pi;
 elseif (Zobs(2) <= -pi) % was negative
    Zobs(2) = Zobs(2) + 2*pi;
 end

For the predicted measurements
q    = (map(i,1) - est_robot(1))^2 + (map(i, 2) - est_robot(2))^2;
    Zpre = [                                                             sqrt(q);

4296,Calculate object distance with camera,"Firstly I'm unsure whether this question belongs here or on another SE site (but I'll wing it for now).
I've recently been given the job of connecting up a 'smart camera' to a setup where a robotic arm will pick and place objects from point A to point B. The real application for the camera is to check if the objects are out of alignment to their supposed positions.
However I am curious to see if there is any way I can calculate the distance of an object given that I already know the objects actual size. Naturally the camera will see the object as bigger when closer and smaller when farther away but how can I turn this information into depth/distance from the camera?
I have not yet started using the camera. For now it is just an idea. I will assume that I can calculate what percentage of the view frame is taken up by the object.
For example if I have an object of uniform shape, I know that from dist1 it takes up 75% of the view frame and from dist2 it takes up 45% of the view frame.

Should this prove to be possible I imagine that it could have a number of different applications. /Anyway any feedback is appreciated. Thanks! ( :

(rather than testing it in some kind of software simulator only) However, I want the system to be autonomous and running on-board of the rover. 
The system I am talking about will consist of:
a stereo camera
a rover with wheels with one motor each 
possibly some kind of sensor that ""measures"" the movement, e.g. how much the wheels turned
maybe some distance sensor

Now my question:
as mentioned I have no idea about robotics, and also my electronics knowledge is limited, so I have no idea what I need for this robot when it comes to the processor and the electronics. 
I read some stuff about the Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards but I have no idea what to make from this. I am afraid that a Arduino will not be able to handle the computational load of the stereo vision and the SLAM algorithm but I read that Raspberry Pis are not the first choice when interfacing with sensors is needed (in this case my stereo cameras). Also I found the Leika kit which is a robotics kit for the Raspberry Pi. Maybe this would be a good option for me?
Maybe an entirely different system would be even more advisable? 
Possibly someone else build an equally complex system before and can give me some advise form his/her experience?

We need a way to get position feedback, the potentiometer system we are using seems to work, however it adds to much extra hardware(more stuff to break), (ie) the gear on the potentiometer and the gear on the shaft have to mesh constantly and we have to zero the potentiometer every time we put the leg together so the potentiometer doesn't over spin.  * We would prefer to have an optical encoder inside the motor.

However, I recently wondered if there's a rule of thumb or guideline for how much overhead is useful, before it becomes a waste.
For a (perhaps oversimplified) example, say I have a lever to lift something, and the force needed is 100 Newtons. An actuator that can manage 100 N maximum will have problems with this and stall, with any sort of friction or other imperfections. I would use an actuator that can produce 150 or 200 N - whatever is available and fits the design and budget. After testing, it may become apparent that 200 is overkill, 120 is sluggish, but 150 is good. Other than trial and error, is there a way to measure this, or a rule of approximation?

4360,Natural frequency computation (for PID gains computations),"I am currently trying to parametrize the low-level gains of a robotic arm. This arm uses a classical PID for each joint.
I am trying to use a method based on computation rather than a trial-and-error/tweaking approach. The method I use considers each joint independently and assumes the system driven by the PID is linear. Hence I infer a transfer function, a characteristic polynomial, poles and this gives me gains $K_p$, $K_i$, and $K_d$ for each joint.
Now, computed as I did, these gains depend on the natural angular-frequency. For example:
$$
K_p = 3 a w^2
$$
where $a$ is the inertia and $w$ is the natural angular-frequency.
Hence my question: how shall I compute $w$, the natural angular-frequency for my system? Is this an enormous computation involving the geometry and other complex characteristics of the robot, and that only a computer can do or are there simple assumptions to be made which can already give a rough result for $w$?
I guess this is a complex computation and this is one of the reasons why PID gains are most often found by trial-and-error rather than from computation. Though I am looking for some more details on the subject to help me understand what is possible and what is not.

4362,Mechanical or electrical engineering for robotic and automation?,"I have decided to pursue a career in automation and robotic. At the moment, I am being torn between Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. I know that both of them relate to my choices of career, and at the moment, I think that I like them equally. I hope you guys can help me solve my dilemma by using your insights/experiences to assist me with the following questions:   
1/ From your experiences and opinions, which of the two engineering fields is generally more crucial and challenging, especially in an automation/robotics project?
2/ Which will see an increase in demand and importance in the near future? Which of them might become outdated/obsolete or at least develop at a slower rate compare to the other?(I have a feeling that EE has a slight edge over this matter; however, I am not so sure)
3/ Which of the fields is more versatile? Which is more physical demanding (I am actually quite frail)
4/ Which is generally easier to self-study? Robotics is obviously an incredibly broad and complex field and I have prepared to step outside of my comfort zone and do lots of studying by myself to achieve my goals and passion.

4366,PID in a system with pole at origin,"I've seen in a lot of places some methods of tuning a PID controller. Most of them will say that one should apply a step input to the system and based on that response you can tune the PID parameters following some rule of thumb. But what about a system which one of its pole is at origin? In other words, a step response on a system like that will have an infinitely increasing ramp in the output (theoretically).
An example:
let's say we have a spinning wheel (fixed at center) and all we can control is the amount of torque applied to make it spin. If we can read its position (angle) and we want to design a PID controller to set its position (more or less like a step-motor). How can that be done? Note that a step input in this case will be a constant torque and this will make the wheel spin faster and faster. How should one proceed?

4369,Artificial Potential Field navigation,"I've been working on my two-wheeled mobile robot I've been trying to perfect my obstacle avoidance algorithm which is Artificial Potential Field method . Also i use Arduino Uno kit . The basic concept of the potential field approach is to compute a artificial potential field in which the robot is attracted to the target and repulsed from the obstacles. The artificial potential field is used due to its computational simplicity. the mobile robot applies a force generated by the artificial potential field as the control input to its driving system . the Artificial Potential Field method in its computations depends on the distance between robot and goal or target and the distance between robot and obstacles that effected the robot (which could easily get for ultrasonic senors)
I applied the Artificial potential field method in Matlab environment / simulation and it is done successfully , really what I need in the simulation is to get the current position of mobile robot and position of goal as x, y coordinates (to compute the distance between robot and goal) and the obstacles positions.
The output of the Artificial potential field is the desired angle to avoid obstacle and reach to the goal , the method give the robot the angle the pointed to the goal then the robot goes toward that angle and if the robot face an obstacle in his way (got from sensor reading) the Artificial potential field will update the angle to avoid the obstacle and then re-give the robot the angle that pointed to the goal and so on.
The question is how could I apply the Artificial potential field method in real would? what should I get? is it easy to do that or it is impossible? 
I had Rover 5 with two normal DC motors and two encoders (incremental rotary encoder) per each wheel.
Any Help or suggestion on the topic will be highly appreciated please.

Edit: Based on the response from Shahbaz.
The case is very simple, but first, there is something to know that I constrained with some limitations that I couldn't overstep them, one of them is that the real world should be exactly as simulation for example in the simulation I consisted that robot started with (0,0) on coordinates  x, y axis and I should put the goal point for example (10,20)  and feed this point in the Artificial potential field method and then compute distance between  robot and goal (so I don't need any technique to determine the position of goal) and I don't know if I could applied that.
The second constraint is that I should use the encoders of wheels to determine the current position of mobile robot and its orientation depending on a calculation formula (something like this here) even if that will be inaccurate.
I had a Rover 5 with two normal DC motors and two encoders (incremental rotary encoder) per each wheel, each encoder has four wires I don't know how to deal with them yet, and how could I translate the pulses of encoders or how to work out the x.y position of your robot based on the shaft encoder data.

I was wondering how could I add an additional RockTutorialControl into the composition, so that the instantiation would then create two separate instances of the same component?
I've tried something like
add RockTutorial::RockTutorialControl, :as => ""foo""

but this apparently isn't the way to go. syskit instanciate command shows only one instance of RockTutorialControl, but gives two roles to it (rock and foo). What is the meaning of ""role"" in this context?

EDIT:
This was my first question to StackExchange, and I don't know what's the policy for adding additional information to the original question, but here we go:
It seems that both the deployment and configuration need to be different when there are two instances of the same component. I did a small scale testing with two components:
using_task_library 'foobar_user'
using_task_library 'foobar_proxy'

module FooModule
  class FooControl < Syskit::Composition

  add FoobarUser::Task, :as => ""producer"" 
  add FoobarProxy::Task, :as => ""proxy""
  add FoobarUser::Task, :as => ""consumer"" 

  producer_child.connect_to proxy_child
  proxy_child.connect_to consumer_child
  end
end

where FoobarUser::Task has an input & output port of /std/string. FoobarProxy::Task has corresponding i&o ports. FoobarUser::Task has also two configurations called 'default' and 'other'. It also has two deployments 'foo_depl' and 'bar_depl'.
In order to create a ""pipeline"" where data flows producer ==> proxy ==> consumer, I made define line:
define 'conf_and_depl', FooModule::FooControl.use('producer' => FoobarUser::Task.use_conf('other').prefer_deployed_tasks(/foo_depl/), 'consumer' => FoobarUser::Task.use_conf('default').prefer_deployed_tasks(/bar_depl/))

and then instanciated the network with 
syskit instanciate scripts/03-nwtest.rb conf_and_depl_def!

The component instanciation failed if either use_conf or prefer_deployed_tasks clause was left out. In both cases the produced error was ""cannot deploy the following tasks... ...multiple possible deployments, choose one with #prefer_deployed_tasks"".

Line 19 sets the threshold for the creation of a new landmark: A new landmark is created if the Mahalanobis distance to all existing landmarks in the map exceeds the value $\alpha$. The ML correspondence is then selected in line 20.

The Mahalanobis distance measure in SLAM is define as
  $d^{2}_{M}(z^{j}_{k}, \hat{z}^{i}_{k})$, which provides a measure on
  the spatial difference between measurement $z^{j}_{k}$ and predicted
  feature measurement $\hat{z}^{i}_{k}$, given by  $$ d^{2}_{M}(z^{j}_{k}, \hat{z}^{i}_{k}) = (z^{j}_{k} - \hat{z}^{i}_{k})^{T} S^{-1}_{k}(z^{j}_{k}, \hat{z}^{i}_{k}) $$ This

My approach is using the accelerometer:

Calculates the current g-force of the z-axis
if the g-force is > 0.25 g and longer than 25 ms, then I feed the accelerometer term (cm per s) into the pid
the output is sent to the motors

The model now reacts when it is falling down with an up-regulation of the motors.
However, I am not sure, whether it is smart to feed the current acceleration into the regulator and I currently wonder, whether there is a smarter method to deal with sudden and smaller changes in altitude.

The size of the receptive field represents the value of the standard variation. The bigger the size is, the more pixels will be taken into consideration when Gaussian filtering, and so we ""mix"" more information in a single value.

4449,Assumptions about the nature of landmarks in SLAM algorithms,"I'm trying to understand the role of landmarks in SLAM algorithms.  I've glanced over a few books concerning landmark based SLAM algorithms and I've come up with a rudimentary understanding which I believe is flawed.
How I think SLAM works:
As I understand it, landmarks are a set of points in a map whose locations are known a priori.   Furthermore, the number of landmarks in a map is fixed.  The number of landmarks detected at any one time may change, but the number of landmarks that exist in the map remains static at all times.  
My understanding is that SLAM algorithms exploit the fact that these points are both uniquely identifiable and known a priori.   That is, when a robot senses a landmark, it knows exactly which landmark it detected and thus knows the exact location of that landmark.  Thus, a slam algorithm uses the (noisy) distance to the detected landmarks (with known location) to estimate its position and map.  
Why I think I'm wrong 
In my naive understanding, the usefulness of SLAM would be limited to controlled environments (i.e. with known landmarkds) and completely useless in unknown environments with no a priori known landmarks.  I would presume that some sort of feature detection algorithm would have to dynamically add landmarks as they were detected.  However, this fundamentally changes the assumption that the number of given landmarks must be static at all times.  
I know I'm wrong in my understanding of feature based SLAM, but I'm not sure which of my assumptions is wrong:  
Do feature based SLAM algorithms assume a static number of landmarks?  
Do the landmarks need to be known a priori?  Can they be detected dynamically?  And if so, does this fundamentally change the algorithm itself?
Are there special kinds of SLAM algorithms to deal with unknown environments with an unknown total number of landmarks in it?

Knowing the wheel velocity, and the steering angle a, I need to be able to update the robot's current position and velocity with the new values at time t+1.
The obvious way to do this would be to calculate the position of the centre of rotation, where the axles of the wheels would meet, however, this leads to an undefined centre of rotation when a = 0. This means that the model doesn't work for the normal case of the robot just driving in a straight line.
Is there some other model of Ackerman steering which works over a reasonable range of a?

4492,DC motor control - speed-torque curve,"I am having some trouble understanding how to practically use the speed-torque curve of a DC motor.
I understand that the gradient of the speed-torque curve is defined by the design of the motor, the exact position of the curve depending on the voltage applied. So if the voltage is changed the speed-torque curve is also changed but remains parallel to the initial curve before the voltage was changed. See figure below.

So my intuitive guess is that when using the motor at a given desired operation point (desired speed and desired torque), the corresponding speed-torque curve Cd has a gradient specified in the data sheet of the motor and passes through the operation point. This curve Cd is obtained at a corresponding voltage Vd. See diagram below.

So my next guess is that in order to have the motor operate at this desired operation point, you have to set the voltage applied to the motor to Vd, and apply a current Id (computed using the torque and the torque constant).
Now from what I read this is not what is done in DC motor controllers. These seem to only drive the motor using current and some sort of PWM magic as is shown in the following diagram by maxon.

Anyone knows why voltage is not used in DC motor control and only current is? I do not understand how you can set the speed if you do not modify the voltage? And what is PWM useful for?
I have looked for hours over the internet and could not find anything relevant.
Thanks,
Antoine.

4496,How to get pure end-effector translation through Jacobian?,"I have a 7 DOF arm that I am controlling with joint velocities computed from the Jacobian in the standard way.  For example:
$$
{\Large J} = \begin{bmatrix} J_P \\J_O
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$
J^{\dagger} = J^T(JJ^T)^{-1}
$$
$$
\dot{q}_{trans} = J^{\dagger}_P v_{e_{trans}}
$$
$$
\dot{q}_{rot} = J^{\dagger}_O v_{e_{rot}}
$$
$$
\dot{q} = \dot{q}_{trans} + \dot{q}_{rot}
$$
However, when specifying only translational velocities, the end-end effector also rotates.  I realized that I might be able to compute how much the end-effector would rotate from the instantaneous $\dot{q}$, then put this through the Jacobian and subtract out its joint velocities.  
So I would do this instead of using the passed in $v_{e_{rot}}$:
$$
v_{e_{rot}} =  R(q) - R(q+\dot{q}_{trans})
$$
Where $R(q)$ computes the end-effector rotation for those joint angles.  
Is this OK to do, or am I way off base?  Is there a simpler way?  
I am aware that I could also just compute the IK for a point a small distance from the end-effector with no rotation, then pull the joint velocities from the delta joint angles.  And that this will be more exact.  However, I wanted to go the Jacobian route for now because I think it will fail more gracefully.
A side question, how do I compute $R(q) - R(q+\dot{q}_{trans})$ to get global end-effector angular velocity?  My attempts at converting a delta rotation matrix to Euler angles yield wrong results.  I did some quick tests and implemented the above procedure to achieve pure end-effector rotation while maintaining global position.  (This is easier because $T(q) - T(q+\dot{q}_{rot})$ is vector subtraction.)  And it did kind of work.

But, the problem with this approach as told by my friend is that I am assuming that I already know the locations of the obstacles, which make this all process useless.

I explored NS-RAW with RTKLIB - this would be doable but probably will need either a base station to get the correction data for rover or external correction data which may be a hassle. The action radius with own base station is quite limited too. This solution is not really straightforward while you have to deal with either in-house or streamed correction data.
I am wondering whether one would be able to substantially improve the accuracy of an ordinary (uncorrected) GPS+GLONASS device (maybe one found in a common smartphone) with stereo visual odometry. Today's consumer GNSS chips seem to have reasonably stable accuracy in the 5m range. The VISO 2 library has a translation error of about 3% on 500m distance. The idea is to use the visual odometry for ""smoothing"" the rough GPS track. 
The question is how this can be technically done in terms of SW. The input would be two tracks - one from GPS device and the other VISO 2 library. I think I need a kind of filter that will fuse the sensor data to get greater precision.

body_ang_previous_.psi_dot   = body_ang_current_.psi_dot;

The model seems to work well but, as like reported in many papers, is very unstable and needs some controls.
The first approach for me was to create a controller (PD) to keep the height constant without moving the quadcopter, but just putting a value (for example 3 meter) and see how it reacts.
Here the small code I tried:
/* PD Controller */
double e = ( 3.0 - body_pos_current_.z );  // 3.0 is just a try value!!!
thrust_.esum = thrust_.esum + e;
thrust_.total = 1.3 * e + 0.2 * real_duration * thrust_.esum;

The problem, as you can see here in this video, is that the copter starts falling down into the ground and not reaching the desired altitude (3.0 meters).
Then it comes back again again like a spring, which is not damped.
I tried already many different value for the PD controller but it seems that it doesn't affect the dynamic of the model.
Another strange thing is that it goes always to a negative point under the ground, even if I change the desired height (negative or positive).
What s wrong in my code? 
Could you me please point to some documents or code which is understandable and well documented to start?
Thanks
EDIT:
Many thanks to your suggestion.
Hi was really surprise to know, that my code had lots of potential problems and was not very efficient. So I elaborate the code as your explanation and I implementers a RK4 for the integration. After I ve read those articles: here and here I got an idea about RK and its vantage to use it in simulations and graphics PC.
As an example I rewrote again the whole code:
/* Calculate the acceleration about all 6 axis */
pos_.dVel.x =  ( ( thrust_.total / masse_ ) * ( -sin( body_position_.angle.theta ) * cos( body_position_.angle.phi ) * cos( body_position_.angle.psi ) - sin( body_position_.angle.phi ) * sin( body_position_.angle.psi ) ) );
pos_.dVel.y =  ( ( thrust_.total / masse_ ) * ( sin( body_position_.angle.phi ) * cos( body_position_.angle.psi ) - cos( body_position_.angle.phi ) * sin( body_position_.angle.theta ) * sin( body_position_.angle.psi ) ) );
pos_.dVel.z =  ( ( thrust_.total / masse_ ) * ( -cos( body_position_.angle.phi ) * cos( body_position_.angle.theta ) ) - 9.81 );

pos_.dOmega.phi   = ( torque_.phi   / Jxx_ );
pos_.dOmega.theta = ( torque_.theta / Jyy_ );
pos_.dOmega.psi   = ( torque_.psi   / Jzz_ );

/* Get position and velocities from accelerations */
body_position_ = RKIntegrate( body_position_, real_duration );

which is much more clear and easy to debug. Here some useful functions I implemented:
QuadrotorController::State QuadrotorController::evaluate( const State &initial, const Derivative &d, double dt ) {

const double C4 = 1.0f, A41 = 0.0f, A42 = 0.0f, A43 = 1.0f;

const double B1 = 1.0f/6.0f, B2 = 1.0f/3.0f, B3 = 1.0f/3.0f, B4 = 1.0f/6.0f;

Derivative k1 = sampleDerivative( 0.0f, state );
Derivative k2 = sampleDerivative( C2 * dt, evaluate( state, k1 * A21, dt ) );
Derivative k3 = sampleDerivative( C3 * dt, evaluate( state, k1 * A31 + k2 * A32, dt ) );
Derivative k4 = sampleDerivative( C4 * dt, evaluate( state, k1 * A41 + k2 * A42 + k3 * A43, dt ) );

const Derivative derivativeSum = k1 * B1 + k2 * B2 + k3 * B3 + k4 * B4;

return evaluate( state, derivativeSum, dt );
}

Now I m really lost because...because the simulated qudrotor has the same behavior as before. Nevertheless I ve implemented the same PD algorithm as discussed in the paper, it stabilize on Z (height) but it get really crazy due to unstable behavior. 
So... I dunno what is wrong in my code and my implementation. And above all I cannot find any source in internet with a good self explaned dynamic model for a quadrotor.

$P\left(z_t|x_t,m \right)=\prod_{i=1}^{n}P'\left(z_i|x_t,m \right)$    
My scan has 360 rays i.e $n=360$, When i calculate $P\left(z_t|x_t,m \right)$ it becomes zero as multiplication all propabilities $<1.$ 
In ROS amcl they are using ad-hoc which works better like
$P\left(z_t|x_t,m \right)+=\sum_{i=1}^{n}P'\left(z_i|x_t,m \right)*P'\left(z_i|x_t,m \right)*P'\left(z_i|x_t,m \right)$
later they normalise it with number of particle to get weight of each particle.
My query is how to get probability normalised and not zero with single calculation (i.e image in case of single particle)
Thanks.

4578,kinect - development kit to aid obstacle-avoiding robot?,"Some friends and I are interested in working on a robot. I know little to nothing about robotics, but do have a lot of experience with programming. Before we start, I am hoping that I can find some development kits or libraries that will help aid the goals of the robot. Which are:

Robot needs to move from point A to point B. While moving, it needs to detect rocks (approx. 1 foot diameter) on ground. It needs to detect rocks that are big enough to stop it, turn away from them, and proceed. 

In theory, we will want to detect the kinect's angle via the accelerometers, and use that data to obtain Cartesian coordinates of the ground from the kinect's sensors. Later, we will want a way to assemble a 'map' in the robot's memory so that it can find better paths from A to B.
Right now we aren't concerned with the motors on the robot - only the vision element. Ie, I am not really interested in software that interfaces with the motors of the robot, only only something that interfaces with the kinect.

4579,Quadrature Encoder Counts,"Actually , I have been since two weeks looking for convinced and final solution for my problem , actually I am completely lost , I am working on mobile robot (Rover 5) with 2 motors , 2 encoders . the controller that designed to the robot needs to know the odometery of mobile robot (X ,Y, Heading Angle ) , actually I am trying to function the encoders for this purpose , getting X ,Y, Heading Angle by measuring the traveled distance by each wheel , so to get the X ,Y, Heading Angle values , I should compute a accurate readings without missing any counts or ticks as could as possible .
The problem now is :
In the code in the attachment , while I am testing the encoders counts , I noticed that there is a difference between counts of encoders even when they spin in the same constant speed (PMW) , the difference increases as the two motors continue . so I thought that is the main cause of inaccurate odometery results .
In the output of the code (in the attachment also) the first two columns are right and left motors speed , the third & forth columns are right and left encoder counts , the fifth column is the difference between two encoders count , as you could see ,that even when the speed of two motors are approximately the same (each motor feed up with 100 PWM) there is a difference in the encoder counts and as you could see that the difference become big and big as the motors continuing spin .
One thing I thought that sending the same PWM value to two different motors will almost never produce the exact same speed , so I think that I should detect the absolute motion of the motors and adjust the power to get the speed/distance , but when I test the speed of motors after feed them with 100 PWM at same time , the two speeds were almost identical , but I noticed that there is a difference between counts of two encoders even when the motors spin in the same constant speed .
Actually , I don't know where is the problem , Is it in the code ? Is it in the hardware ? or what ? I am completely lost , I need for patient someone to help.

4580,Linear slider motor mount location - Pros/cons,"I'm currently designing a linear camera slider, that will be used to hold camera equipment weighing just about 15 Kgs including all of the lenses and monitors and everything else. 
For those who don't know what a camera slider is, it's a linear slider on top of which a camera is mounted and then the camera is slided slowly to create some nice footage like this.
The problem
Now, looking at the commercially available camera sliders out there, there seems to be two ways in which the motor maybe mounted on these sliders:

Motor mounted on the side:

Motor mounted directly on the carriage:


I would like to know which option would be optimal - Performance-wise (this slider maybe used vertically too, to create bottom to top slide shots), efficiency-wise and 
which one of these two will be resistant to motor vibration (these motors vibrate a lot, the effects of which may sometimes leak into the produced footage).
Additional Questions

Motor mounted on the carriage directly maybe, just maybe more efficient, but it also has to carry it's own weight in addition to the 15kg camera load?
Pulling force is greater than pushing force (I have no idea why, would be great if someone explained why, atleast in this case?), so a motor mounted in the end should be able to lift vertically with ease?
Does a belt setup as shown in the first figure above really dampen the motor vibrations? Will/won't the motor vibrating on the end get amplified (because, the whole setup will be attached to a single tripod in the exact center of the slider)
Which design will be less stressful for the motor, taking inertia into consideration for both cases?
Which one of these designs will be best suitable for vertical pulling of load against gravity?

Manufacturers use both designs interchangeably, so it's hard to predict which design is better than which.
Any help would be much appreciated!
Please note, this question has been migrated from the Stackexchange Physics (and Electrical) forum by me because the mods thought it would be appropriate here.

Ideally, my team is looking for a simple beacon system, where beacon A  would be attached to the robot, while beacon B would be attached to a known point on the competition space. Then, beacon A can give information about how far away B is. After some searching, I could only turn up laser rangefinders that required pointing at the target. I am a CS student, so I'm not familiar with the terminology to aid searches.
Another nice property would be if the beacons also gave the angle of beacon A in beacon B's field of view, although this is not necessary, since multiple beacons could be used to obtain this information.
We have an Xbox 360 Kinect working, and able to track things and give distances, but it looses accuracy over distance quickly (the arena is about 6 meters long), and this beacon should be as simple as possible. We ONLY need it for a relative position of our robot.
Alternate Solution:
Another way to solve this would be for an omni-directional beacon to only give angle information, two of these could be used to triangulate, and do the job just as well.

When I assign them to be zero, the error of the estimation this landmark won't change as time goes. If I assign them with very large value, the estimation is getting better every time the robot reobserves this landmark however, the error approaches to fixed value not to zero.

The arm joint 1 and arm joint 5 are revolute and rotate about the world z-axis (pointing to the sky)
But the other 3 joints are all revolute and rotate about x-axis, let's say (points horizontally)
DH convention says the ""joint distance"" is along the ""common normal"". But unless I am mistaken, the only common normal is the y-axis, and that is also horizontal, meaning there is no joint distance.
I was thinking I would use link offset for joint1 - joint2, but then I ran into a problem with joint4 - joint5. Link offset is supposed to be along the previous z-axis, and in that case it would point horizontally out to nowhere. But link distance STILL doesn't work either, because that is the common normal distance, and as established the common normal is x-axis, also horizontal. So now I feel very screwed. I am sure there is a simple solution but I can't see it. 
So I guess the question is, how do I use the DH convention for the links between 1-2 and 4-5, when the joint rotational axes are perpendicular?

Everywhere I've seen online, the stepper motor DYJ48 is used in tutorials, to rotate on its own, or, at most, to spin a clothes pin attached to it. I am trying to get Arduino to work for my 10 year old kid. He's got the motor rotating, now what? How does he attach anything to it?

4642,Finding a light load high precision servo motor,"I have a project that requires me to be able to accurately and repeatedly rotate an object 120 degrees.
The object is small and lightweight (let's say several grams). The axis does not necessarily have to always spin the same direction. It simply needs to be able to stop reliably at 0, +/- 120, and +/-240 degrees from the origin.
I have VERY limited experience with motors and robotics, but my understanding is that a servo motor will be my best bet for accuracy (if that incorrect, please let me know).
Since I know next to nothing about these motors, the spec sheets list a lot of specs which don't mean all that much to me. I'm hoping to learn, but in the mean time, what specifications do I need to be focusing on for these requirements?
It doesn't need to be high speed. When I say accurate, it doesn't have to be absolutely perfect to the micrometer, but I would like it to be able to run through a loop of stopping at 0, 120, and 240 hundreds of times without visually noticeable variance - the more precise the better though.
To be more specific about the accuracy. Let's say the object being rotated will have a flat surface on the top at each of those 3 stopping points.  Upon inspection the surface needs to appear level each and every time through hundreds of cycles.
Could these requirements be met by a servo that might be used in building a quadricopter, or am I going to be looking for something higher grade than that?

Since this servo uses serial communication, I need an additional serial port to interface with Xbee module. Although it seems to be very common application controlling these servos wirelessly based on Arduino, I could't find any of them in web. I found the two very well constructed libraries.
. This library is for MX28T servo, which is the same servo I am trying to use, but it uses UNO;therefore, I cannot interface with Xbee.
. This library use UART1 (serial1) to interface with servo (AX-12) motors. Therefore, I can connect Xbee module to UART0. But, the problem is that this library is outdated and not compatible with MX64-T servo anymore.

Is there any one who has experience in controlling Dynamixel MX24T, MX64T servo series using Xbee module simultaneously? If you have experience, please share with me.
Is it possible for Arduino Mega can interface with Xbee module using Serial1 (i.e., RX18 TX19)? If it can, I might be able to use the library1 without any modification.

$$\vec{y}=\textbf{C}\vec{x}+\textbf{D}\vec{u} $$if the measurements of its output $y$ are performed in irregular intervals? (suppose the input can always be measured).

My initial approach was to design a Luenberger observer using estimates $\hat{\textbf{A}}$, $\hat{\textbf{B}}$, $\hat{\textbf{C}}$ and $\hat{\textbf{D}}$ of the abovementioned matrices, and then update it periodically every $T_s$ seconds according the following rule:

If there has been a measurement of $y$ since the last update: $$\dot{\hat{x}}=\hat{\textbf{A}}\hat{x}+\hat{\textbf{B}}\hat{u}+\textbf{L}(y_{measured}-\hat{\textbf{C}}\hat{x})$$
  If not:
  $$\dot{x}=\hat{\textbf{A}}\hat{x}+\hat{\textbf{B}}\hat{u}$$

(I have omitted the superscript arrows for clarity)
I believe that there may be a better way to do this, since I'm updating the observer using an outdated measurement of $y$ (which is outdated by $T_s$ seconds in the worst case).

4675,Position Controller for a Quadrotor,"I have a question regarding the implementation of a quadrotor's position controller. 
In my Matlab model the quadrotor takes 4 inputs: a desired altitude ($Z_{des}$) and desired attitude angles($\Phi_{des}$, $\Theta_{des}$, $\Psi_{des}$) which reflects the motion described by the differential equations of the model (see last picture). 

Here an insight into the implemented Matlab dynamic model. As you can see it has a structure like an inner loop controler:

Anyway...it ""hovers"" perfectly on the starting point. (perfect graphs :) )
Now I just need to go over and implement a sort of position controller to let the quadrotor to get from a start to a goal point, defined as usual through 3 coordinates $[X_d, Y_d, Z_d]$. 
That's tricky because I don't have the same space state variables as input and output of the system. So the controller must take a vector of three coordinates and be able to output 3 different angles to get there. The only exception is the height because it will be simply bypassed by the controller and doesn't need another calculation loop. A different story is for the three angles... 
My first idea was to simply create a feedback between the position given at the output of the simulated system and the desired position as in the figure above.
But that rises another question: my quadrotor model solves the following equation system:
$$
\large \cases{ 
 \ddot X = ( \sin{\psi} \sin{\phi} + \cos{\psi} \sin{\theta} \cos{\phi}) \frac{U_1}{m}  \cr
 \ddot Y = (-\cos{\psi} \sin{\phi} + \sin{\psi} \sin{\theta} \cos{\phi}) \frac{U_1}{m} \cr
 \ddot Z = (-g + (\cos{\theta} \cos{\phi}) \frac{U_1}{m} \cr
 \dot p  = \frac{I_{YY} - I_{ZZ}}{I_{XX}}qr - \frac{J_{TP}}{I_{XX}} q \Omega + \frac{U_2}{I_{XX}} \cr
 \dot q  = \frac{I_{ZZ} - I_{XX}}{I_{YY}}pr - \frac{J_{TP}}{I_{YY}} p \Omega + \frac{U_3}{I_{YY}} \cr
 \dot r  = \frac{I_{XX} - I_{YY}}{I_{ZZ}}pq - \frac{U_4}{I_{ZZ}}
}
$$
that means that they expect (as in the matlab model above) the desired angles and height. 
But now I need right the inverse: given a desired position calculate the right angles!!! 
For the direction is the solution really simple, since I can write something like:

where y and x lies on the horizontal plane. This is not so simple for the other two angles. So what can I do at this point? Just ""invert"" the given equations to get the desired angles?
Another idea could be to implement a simple PD or PID controller. This is much more easier given the fact that I can experiment very quickly using Simulink and get very good results. But the problem is here again: how get I the desired angles from a desired position?

I am looking for advice on how to mount the mg995 servos to allow them to tilt and pan. I originally thought about having a base with a metal rod through the middle and use a gear to control the pan functionality. The idea is it would mimic a skateboard truck with a gear that would turn the rod through the middle and pivot the shooting mechanism. Another idea was to have the metal plate sit on top of the servo and use one of the attachments to attach it to the top plate. The problems I see behind this is the attachment is just a small piece of plastic and over a short period of time I could see this wearing out especially if the shooting mechanism is not centered perfectly. I also need to come up with a solution to make it tilt but I think I have an idea for this to simply use a rod with a gear to turn the pvc pipe barrel.

For anyone intersted I found an example of someone doing almost exactly the same thing with blueprints. I am going a slightly simpler / cheaper route and mounting the servo to the bottom of the spinning plate between the lazy susan plate I ordered.

For the purpose I'm using a PID control system, where the reference is given from a ultrasonic sensor. So my problem here is im having a hard time tuning the PID. I know i can find the P coefficient pretty easily by plotting the desired set point range vs desired motor output speed. Even then the robot is not so stable, so i though of adding DI part of PID.

How can i gain such knowledge to model something mathematically and implement such in real life? How much math and what areas of mathematics do i need to learn and how can i learn such?

4764,Which is more useful? Instantaneous rate of change of displacement or Average rate of change of displacement?,"Instantaneous rate of change of displacement is given by,

while average rate of change of displacement is given by, 
v(t) = (s(t[n]) - s(t[n-1]))/(t[n] - t[n-1])

The first one gives the slope or derivative of a displacement function at a particular instant of time and thus varies with time. I was wondering how is it going to help me calculate the velocity of my robot's end effector, which is the foot of the leg of the robot(bipedal). If i make a reading of the position of the robot every 1ms to keep the approximation as accurate as possible, my instantaneous velocity would be zero wouldn't it? Since my robot wouldn't have moved anywhere in 1ms time. Agreed, 't' would increment as t+dt, dt == 0.001s. Then v(t) would be v(0.001) = s(0.002) - s(0.001) which is zero, because there is no displacement in that small time frame, right? Am I doing something wrong here? Or on the other hand, do I just use average rate of change?
I have this question, since, if there is a manipulator, in my case the foot of my robot, and it's trajectory is given by a 3x3 homogenous matrix,
[{c(t),-s(t), 0},
 {s(t), c(t), 0},
 {  0,    0,  1}], where c,s are cos(theta) and sin(theta)respectively,

if on paper, this is differentiated, this would give me a spatial/body velocity matrix as 
[{0, -d(theta)/dt, 0},
 {d(theta)/dt,  0, 0},
 {    0,        0, 0}]

So how do I compute this differentiation in code. I just need something of the sort of a pseudocode.

4766,how to power extra usb devices for beaglebone black,"I'm building a robot that uses a beaglebone black, however I have several different usb devices that I want to connect to it (microphone, usb sound device and some other things). Now I have heard that the usb output of the beaglebone doesn't power more then 0.1A. So the combined draw of these usb devices is likely to exceed this by a fair margin. So I started looking for powered usb hubs to use instead. However these tend to be powered by 220V and my robot currently only has a 12V power supply and a converter to 5V for the beaglebone.

But for navigation to work I'd have to pre-map the room manually or with kinect.  I can put some sensors on this tracked moving object, e.g. IMU, sonar, but not a kinect.

4782,Power switch and common ground on a battle robot,"I am constructing a 5.44Kg Hobby-weight battle robot and one of the safety rules is that the robot must have a power switch that turns off power to the motors (and weapon).
The robot has three sub-systems; the drive motors (one battery), the weapon (another battery) and some lighting (a small 9 volt battery).
I have read that since all these will be connected to the same receiver it is important to have all the electronics sharing a common ground for everything to work properly.
Now I know that usually it is the ""live"" wire that is connected to the switch, but I was thinking of hitting two birds with one stone and connecting all the ground wires (rather than the live wires) to the switch. In this way I still turn off power and also have a common ground. In terms of safety (shorts) etc I am not too concerned because I am using XT 60 connectors and have been careful to use only female plugs for the power leads (so no prongs are visible).
It seems to me that it should work and still be safe enough especially since I am not dealing with mains voltage levels here, but on the other hand I don't want to look stupid.
Does this way of connecting to the switch make sense or am I violating some unwritten law? Is this normal practice? Would it effect the circuitry in any way to have the grounds connected together?
I was also thinking of using a switch from a PC power supply; as far as I know this is rated for reasonably high currents. In my case I will have 3 cordless motors, each of which might be drawing up to 5 amps when under load, so say 15 amps in all. Has anyone out there ever used such switches or did you buy high current ones? In that case what should I ask for?

These are intended for use with my 2 cordless drill motors which will be driving the left and right wheel respectively. The robot will therefore be steered in ""tank mode"" by varying the speed and direction of rotation of the 2 motors using the two joysticks on my Turnigy 9x transmitter.
My question is: I have seen videos on youtube where people calibrate brushless motor controllers (ESCs) using some system of pushing the joystick on a standard transmitter forward and listening to tones and then doing the same for reverse and so on. 
However when I asked the suppliers about a similar procedure for these brushed controllers, all they could say is that they did not need calibration. The exact words were ""It seems that you're talking about transmitter for copters,but this ESC is for RC car or boat. You pull the trigger, it goes forward, you push the trigger, it reverse. And you don't need to calibrate it, just plug it, then it can work.""  
My transmitter is not one of those gun shaped ones used for cars. So am I in trouble with these controllers or should they work correctly out of the box as the supplier seems to be implying?

Now I need to actually choose the exact motors I want to buy from the manufacturer (I am targeting maxon motors as I am not an expert and want no problem). I have a few down to earth questions about linking the mechanical needs to the electrical characteristics:

Maxon states a ""nominal voltage"" in the characteristic sheets. Is that the voltage you should apply to the motor? This may be a dumb question but I have followed the full maxon e-learning course and read about other tutorials on the web and I could not find this information anywhere. Can anyone who knows about motors confirm?
As far as I understand, the nominal torque corresponds to the maximum torque the motor can sustain continuously. So I guess, as a rule of thumb, I should find a motor with a nominal torque = my max torque (after reduction), or around. Right?
Also I chose a motor reference (310005 found here) which has a stated power of 60W, as the nominal voltage is 12V, I was expecting to have a nominal current of 5A, but it states 4A. Where am I wrong?
The motor I chose has nominal speed = 7630rpm - nominal torque = 51.6mNm. My needs are max speed = 50.42rpm / max torque = 10620 mNm. This means a reduction factor of 151 for speed and 206 for torque. Should I choose a gear closer to 151 or 206?
What is the ""rated torque"" mentioned when choosing a gear? I know my input torque (torque on the motor side) and my output torque (torque on the system side), does that correspond to any of these two?

I have followed some theoretical and practical courses on the web but I find it hard to find answers to my down to earth question...

The localization is obtained through our RGB-D camera sensor. We are able to teleoperate and even implement PID controllers for Roll, Pitch, Yaw and Throttle channels for our quadrotor.

However, even at 1500 on every channel, the quadrotor drifts, maybe due to flying indoors and the wind pushes the quadrotor. Once it gains momentum, it drifts.

Afaik the NAO internally uses a pid controller to control the motor. I have no control over the pid or it's parameters. Thus I would like to treat the motor including pid as a black box. Theoretically it should be possible to model pid+motor as a $pt_2$ system, i.e. a second order lti system.
A $pt_2$ system is defined by the following differential equation:
$$T^2\ddot{y}(t) + 2dT\dot{y}(t)+y(t) = Ku(t)$$.
I tried fitting a $pt_2$ model but was unable to find good parameters.
Any idea what model to use for this kind of step response?

I tried modifying the equation to add a maximum joint velocity like this:
$$T^2\ddot{y}(t) + (\frac{2dT\dot{y}(t) + m - |2dT\dot{y}(t) - m|}{2})+y(t) = Ku(t)$$ 
where $m$ is the maximum velocity. The fraction should be equivalent to $min(2dT\dot{y}(t), m)$.
However I am not sure if this is the correct way to introduce a maximum joint velocity. The optimizer is unable to find good parameters for the limited velocity formula. I am guessing that is because the min() introduces an area where parameter changes do not cause any optimization error changes.

4836,How to control PID Yaw,"My yaw angle varies from -180 degree to 180 degree. 

If my current heading is about 170 degree, then the wind makes it rotate to the left at about -170 degree, then how can PID control it to make it rotate back to the right at 170 degree.
Since, for PID   ERROR = SETPOINT - INPUT
In my case, SETPOINT = 170, and INPUT = -170, the the ERROR = 170 - (-170) = 340.
So instead of moving to the right and apply PWM = 20, it rotate to the left and apply PWM = 340 and come back to the desired position, which is 170 degree?

4847,Understanding a sliding mode controller for quadrotors,"I'm really willing to understand and implement such a controller (sliding mode) for a quadrotor.
I've found this interesting document explaining that topic.
If you scroll down until page 381 (don't be scared, the document is just 6-7 pages) you can find the following height control law (equation .19):
$$
U_1 = \frac{m}{\cos{\phi}\cos{\theta}}[c_1(\dot z_r - \dot z) + \ddot z_r + \epsilon_1  sgn(s_1) + k_1 s_1 + g]
$$
The explanation of most of the term should be quite easy, but let's focus on the variable z, the height (or altitude if absolute) of the quadrotor. Anyway the control law ""pretends"" not only the goal height z (through $s_{1}$) but even the vertical speed $\dot z_{r}$ and vertical acceleration $\ddot z_{r}$ (r means here reference).
Now...to me is not clear whether those variables the setpoints are, that must be reached once the quadrotor reaches its predefined height or they just symbolize an abstract mathematical formalism but are going to be most of the time Zero (because I want to reach the target height with $z = z_{r}$ but $\dot z_{r} = \ddot z_{r} = 0$)
?!?!?
I hope my question is clear. Even if this I put in the title ""sliding control"" I think it may be helpful for other type of controllers.

Would I have time to turn the r/c switch off before irrevocable damage occurs (once I am obviously observing the action?). Notes. I will be using an on/off switch on the r/c to just turn the motor on and off (so no proportional speed increase etc), plus I will be using an 11.1 volt battery even though the motor is rated for a 21 volt maximum.

I have some question regarding the implementation of a quadrotor in that
 framework.

3D movements: A quadrotor has 6DOF and moves in a 3D 
environment. Looking at the various ROS packages I could not find any 
package that allows to drive a ""robot"" in the 3D space. The package 
/move_base for instance allows only 2D. Make sense to use this 
package for such a project? I thought to use 2D navigation projecting 
the ""shadow"" of a quadrotor on the ground...
MoveIt: it seems a real interesting and promising package, but I
read that it is for robotic arms and not expressly indicate for 
quadrotor. Maybe one can use the possibility to create a virtual 
floating joints in MoveIt to let the quadrotor any movement in a 3D 
environment...that's ok, but I cannot understand whether is ""too much"" 
and not useful for a flying robot.
Trajectories: The possibility to create a 3D trajectory in the 
space seems to be not a standard package of ROS. I found Octomap 
which allows the creation of 3D maps from sensor datas. Very interesting
and for sure very useful. But...I don't think it could be useful for 
creating 3D trajectories.  Should I in that case create an extra package
to compute 3D trajectories to be feed into the quadrotor? Or there 
already something like that?

There is already an existing project hector_quadrotor which seems to 
acclaim a good success ans it is very considered in the field. Most 
people refer to that project when speaking or answering question 
regarding quadrotors in ROS. I saw many times that project...since 
weeks. And due to the total lack of documentation I didn't try anymore 
to understand how it works. Really too difficult.

please?

package I can/cannot use.

Now, I did some research on finding a(preferably small) texture sensor for soldering into an electronic circuit, similar to those little temperature sensors one can buy.

Everything works as expected except for the power supply which makes me pull most of the hair in my head for 2 weeks now. Hope someone could help.
The 2 24V motors run off the batteries directly. Now for my scooter, I need a +12V line for the half bridge drivers, and a +5V line for the signal part. For +12V I am using a LM2576-12 hooked to the batteries (+24) and for the +5V signal I am using a LM2596 ADJ, also hooked directly to the batteries (or is it supposed to be hooked to the output of LM2576-12 for better performance??).
The problem is that, when the motors are under load this power supply system makes the microcontroller hang (or reset I am not too sure, since everytime I have to try to turn off the power switch immediately, because the motor keeps running with whatever value they are fed with right before this happens), usually within 1 minute of riding, which is very dangerous when someone is onboard.
I have read and re-read the datasheet of LM2576 and LM2596 many times, and have tried many settings, from recommended to different values of capacitor and inductor. For the diode, I am using the SS34.
I guess its not because of electromagnetic interference, since while I do have the PCB located near the motors, the PCB is actually put inside a homemade Faraday cage which is grounded (Battery -), and the motor cases are also grounded. Plus that the microcontroller only hangs when motors are under load (i.e. me on board), especially when I go from forward to backward.
The motor controller is self made, using 8 x AUIRF2804S MOSFETs. I also put 4 x 1000uF caps between the motors and the +24V.

4903,Self-locking actuator: Friction versus worm gear,"I am planning to control my bicycle derailleur with an electronic circuit, the advantages being multiple but not topic of this question.
The actuation would be performed by placing the assembly very close to the derailleur (but not on it) and by winding the usual steel cable around a spool placed on axis of a gear, and by using a motor to turn the gear. 
This question concerns the alternatives for the spool self-locking mechanism (and eventually the kind of motor to use).
In the literature I found  and other similar ones that directly modify the derailleur with a stepper motor, and then are forced to keep the stepper motor powered up all the time to keep some torque on the shaft. I consider this inefficient, therefore I require a self-locking system to be able to remove power.
I come up with two ideas:

worm gear operated by a DC motor, where the steel cable is wound around the gear. This system is self-locking or almost self-locking, according to the gear ratio: the gear cannot (easily) drive the worm.
a motor driving normal gears with an appropriate reduction factor, but with an additional friction element, whose friction force is greater than the strength of the spring mounted on the derailleur (sorry if I mixed the technical terms). This is what normal bicycles already have: the friction along the cable and in the element placed n the handle is high and keeps the derailleur in place.

Both system would be assisted by a position-sensitive element (a trimmer?) to detect the actual position of the gear and/or of the derailleur, all configured in a closed feedback loop.
I don't consider additional options for the gear such as this one:  that consists of parallel-axis gears, whose teeth are however shaped in a manner to achieve self-locking without the need of a low-efficiency worm system.
From my point of view, I cannot see any clear advantage of worm gear vs friction except for:

the worm gear may allow me to build a more compact assembly, thanks to the two axes being perpendicular
speed vs torque: worm gears reduce the torque requirements, but the motor has to spin a lot and I cannot wait 3 seconds for each gear change.

Concerning the choice of the motor type (this is not the main question though), I think that:

a worm gear allows me to easily use a DC motor, since torque requirements are low and I don't need to detect the position of the shaft. Moreover, DC motors increase torque with decreasing speed, while stepper motors have the maximum torque defined by the stepping frequency.
DC are more compact and cheaper, important if I decide to offer this assembly as a kit and not unique, personal prototype.
I am working with 5V supply and I fear most easy-to get DC motors (old printers, scrap electronics) work on 12V, with a significant reduction of the available torque when operated at 5V.

4928,Simplest and cheapest way to create a spring back latch,"My and a friend are hacking together a Nespresso Coffee pod dispenser. We have our heart set on a particular design after thinking up countless ways of dispensing a single pod. 
The design has a single flavour of pods in a vertical tube so they tend to fall down. One or more latches around the base of the tube stop any pods from falling out. Releasing the latch for 45ms will allow the pod through (10mm fall, well past the lip of the pod) while catching the next one.
The latch is the problem component. I haven't yet found a suitable product off the shelf. Ideally, the solution would be compact and cheap (< $5). 
Here are some of the latch ideas to date (most of which are considered linear in motion):

Solenoid - Seems over-kill and tend to be > 5 dollars each
Ultrasonic Motor - Can't find any
Linear Actuator - Usually around 50 dollars and quite bulky
Piezoelectric Actuator - Mostly tuned for nM scale precision, and are hard to come by.
Rotating disk with release notch, driven by stepper motor - still > $5 and moderately bulky.
Rotating latch with string attached to rack and pinion powered by electric motor - Don't think it's a simple enough solution.
Rotating cam - how a gumball machine works (I suspect). (This was also suggested in an answer, but would involve both a mechanical and electronic motor component, not as simple as option [5])

I have a 3D printer, so I am open to mechanical solutions - a custom latch with crude electromagnet for example.

Note the desired size of the latch (Yellow), holding pods (Orange) in a tube (Black). Yes, motors can work, but they would be quite bulky. I'm not after the obvious solution, but a clever one, or one which finds the suitable product.
(I understand that with only one latch on one side, the pods will not sit perfectly vertical, and the latch would need to be higher up.)

So here is the problem, up for discussion or a solution.. but first I must point out (a) that the overall weight limitation in turn imposes chassis weight limitations (b) that this is my first ever robot wars entry, and (c) I am likely to be up against cutting and tearing devices. 
I already have the weights of the different materials in hand, so all of the following options are possible in terms of weight.
Option 1: Do it all in 6 mm Polycarbonate.
Option 2: Combine a thin (2 mm aluminum) outer shell with an underlying 3 mm polycarbonate one to get a good mix of the properties of both (rigid and hard, thin and heavy + flexible and strong, thick and light. 
Option 3: As Option 2 but the other way round - 3mm Polycarbonate on the outside and 2 mm Aluminum on the inside.
Should I go with Option 1, 2, 3 or something else altogether that maybe I am not seeing? (Note: having it all in 3 mm aluminum is not possible as it will be too heavy - I checked)
Should I have the aluminum on the outside as a heavy duty shell or on the inside as a ""last resort"" layer? (Note: In my mind these layers would be held together with nuts and bolts with washers to spread any impact loads; but even here should the nuts and bolts be tightened for rigidity or left slightly loose for impact absorption?)
Any advice, especially from people seasoned in the art of robot warfare please?

4933,Power switch standards and suitability for purpose,"I scavenged a 4 terminal power switch (Legion EPS 21) from some electronic device (don't remember what it was) and it has the following markings on it:
Legion EPS21
10A 250VAC TV-5
8A/128A 250V T85 

I would like to use this as the main power switch for my robot which will have nothing higher than 12 volts and a ""normal"" total Amperage (i.e. with all the motors in it running) of around 25 Amps, but of course if a motor stalls then the current will rise much higher. 
First of all I cannot understand how the same switch can be rated for different amperages. I cannot find any datasheets for this switch that might help nor any reference to the standards (TV-5 and T85). So I would like to know if this can handle 128 Amps at 12 Volts. If it helps at all, the wires currently connected to the terminals are quite thick and have ""18 AWG 600 volts"" written on them.
Secondly I would like to ask whether I need to cater for normal running amperage levels or for stall current levels, which are obviously much higher. Although people talk about stall currents running over 100 Amps in some cases - which quite frankly cause me some concern - I cannot seem to be able to find any such switches on any robot component websites, so I am starting to think that it is the ""normal"" level of current I should plan for and not the ""stall"" one. Am I right in this?

4955,Comparison of the efficiency of DC motor current limiting / control methods?,"I am using the wheels and motors of an RC toy car as a simple robotics platform. The car has 2 motors, one drives the back wheels, the other steers the front wheels. The steering motor is stalled by design when steering, it is blocked at a fixed angle by the plastic chassis. It draws 0.85 A when stalled (i.e. anytime when steering).  
Due to this marvel of toy engineering I have to use an oversized motor driver IC (L293B  1A continuous) and this motor draws about 3W of power (0.85A x 3.6V). Im using this IC to control the other (normally rotating) motor as well, which appears to be the same type: 0.85A stall current, around 100mA no-load, and 250-400mA at normal loads. 
Testing with various series resistors I have found out that 0.3A are sufficient to turn the steering wheels and keep them in position. Using a resistor might allow me to use a driver IC with a lower Amp rating (L293D  0.6 A), however the same energy is still wasted, only as heat. While this is not a serious issue with this toy setup, I am planning to build bigger robots with significantly more power, so energy conservation and current control will be important in the long run, and motors may also stall accidentally.
Looking into DC motor current limiting, Ive found the following approaches:

Series resistor  simple, cheap, bidirectional, wastes energy, dissipates heat
Current source with 2-3 transistors and sensing resistor  relatively simple, however Ive only found unidirectional circuits, which would get shorted when switching motor direction. Is there a way to use this method bidirectionally? (and/or with a 2-channel H-bridge IC?  - I cannot place it before the ICs common supply, because the 2 motors draw different currents). 
Chopper circuits/PWM  Will this reliably protect the IC from overload? Is it energy-efficient? 
Are there other other methods I am unaware of? Something on the principles of switching supplies?
Would it be simpler in my application to use 2 separate drivers/h-bridges and place a voltage divider between them, so that a lower voltage is provided for the inefficient stalling motor and more to the one that moves the robot?

So how do the above  methods compare in terms of efficiency and simplicity of design? What is the preferred method in robotics/other DC motor applications?  Also, is it standard practice to limit DC motor current, or a motor is most efficient if allowed to draw as much current as it needs? Is it acceptable to use a DC motor that is mechanically stalled by design, or is this only used in cheap crap toy cars?

Rewrite of question, note no distance measurement is suggested only angle measurements.
I am proposing that it might be possible to have a minimum of 3 local rf beacons and a robot device that sweeps an antenna through a circle identifying the angles between these beacons and to use this information and the order that the beacons are seen to find an absolute location.  I tried to prove this geometrically and it seems that with the 3 beacons there is 2 unique solutions without knowing the order and 1 solution if the order is known.  There would (I believe) be no need to try to find the distance to the beacons.

4986,Backstepping Integrator: changing the virtual control,"given the following differential equation 2ODE in the following form:
$\ddot{z}=-g + ( cos(\phi) cos(\theta))U_{1}/m $
found in many papers (example) and describing the dynamic model of a quadrotor (in this case I'm interested as an example only for the vertical axis $Z$) , I get the movement about $Z$ after integrating the variable $\ddot{z}$ two times. As control input I can control $U_{1}$, which represents the sum of all forces of the rotors.
A Backstepping Integrator (as in many of papers already implemented) defines a tracking error for the height $e_{z} = z_{desired} - z_{real}$ and for the velocity $\dot{e}_{z} = \dot{z}_{desired} - \dot{z}_{real}$ to build virtual controls.
Through the virtual controls one can find the needed valueof $U_{1}$ to drive the quadrotor to the desired height (see the solution later on)
But wait...as said above I need to track both: position error and velocity error.
Now I asked myself, how can I transform such equation and the corresponding virtual controls to track only the velocity??
In my code I need to develop an interface to another package which accepts only velocity inputs and not position information.
I should be able to drive my quadrotor to the desired position using only velocity informations, tracking the error for the z displacement it not allowed.
The solution for the more general case looks like:
$U_{1}=(m/(cos(\phi)cos(\theta))*(e_{z} + \ddot{z}_{desired} + \alpha_{1}^{2}\dot{e}_{z} - \alpha_{1}^{2}e_{z} + g + \alpha_{2}\dot{e}_{z})$
for  $\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2} > 0$
I could simply put brutal the $\alpha_{1} = 0$ for not tracking the position on Z but I think that is not the correct way.
Maybe could you please point me in the right direction?

Whenever I read some guide for wiring a sensor into the Beaglebone (like this one) it always recommends attaching wires directly to GND, +V and signal pins, which is horribly messy and unmaintainable. Even for small projects, you end up having several wires connected to the same GND/5V+ pins, so if you need to replace or repair something, you end up disrupting the wiring for every other component in your project.
Most Arduino guides assume this bad practice too, but at least I've found various ""GVS"" shields to help organize groups of GND/5V/Signal pins so I can attach individual sensor cables.
Is there anything similar for the Beaglebone? I can't find anything appropriate Googling ""breakout"" or ""IO"" cape. I could only find one GVS cape, but it's less than ideal, since it only exposes 5 5V GPIO pins, and everything else it exposes as 3.3V or 1.8V which are incompatible with most peripherals.

5045,How to choose the state space model for 1 axis gyroscope to implemnt a good kalman filter,"I am using this gyroscope in order to measure the rotation of my robot around the z axis.
I want to implement a kalman filter in order to improve the values.

$$
 (k+1)=(k)+dt*'(k)+w(k) 
$$
$$
 y(k)=(k)+z(k)
$$
where $$ is the angle, $'$ is the angular rate given by the gyro and $w$ is the noise. (I hold up my gyro and measured 50 values while it was steady and find out that the variance is equal to 0.0002).
What i want to ask:

is what i did is correct?
How can i find out $z(k)$? .According to the data sheet noise density is equal to 0.03 dps/sqrt(hz),how can i use this information to find out $z(k)$ and correct $w(k)$ if it is wrong.

5047,"Find Centre Of Circle, when robot can ""see"" a partial arc","I originally asked this here but I am struggling to take the concepts, particularly ""Circumcenter"", discussed there and apply it in my context. So here it is in my context...
I have a small robot that can ""see"" (via a camera) a partial arc (from a birds-eye view)
Therefore I know the height and the width of the square and therefore the width and height of the arc, I am sure there must be a way of approximating the circles centre?
What would be the quickest (not necessarily the most accurate) way of helping my robot find the centre.
In my head these are the steps of the problem:

Break up the arc into evenly spaced vectors ?
Work out the angle between the vectors
Use this information to complete the circle ?
Work out radius of circle 
Find the center of the circle

Basically I would love some input on this problem because I think i know

?
Dot Product
?
Add up the lengths of all the vectors to get circumference and then divide by pi, then divide by 2 (or divide by Tau : ) ) 
I think this is where circumcentre comes in

5079,Communicating with syringe pump using PySerial,"Let's first start of by explaining that I do not have a decent background in electronics and interfacing with them, so maybe this is a stupid question. I am currently trying to connect an old Harvard 33 syringe pump (website, PDF manual) to a computer, with the goal of controlling things like pump rates and direction. For this purpose, I connected the instrument to my computer using a D-sub/USB conversion dongle. I then connected to the dongle with PySerial without issues. However, whenever I try to send commands or request the instrument's output, for example , the instrument does not do anything at all. Requesting data (read(100)) returns only a couple of \x00. I suspect I am communicating with the dongle itself rather than the pump. When the pump is turned off or unplugged, I get exactly the same results!
Could anyone explain to me why my method does not work?
My Python code for reference:
import serial # PySerial module

# open the connection
ser = serial.Serial(""/dev/ttyUSB0"", baudrate=9600, bytesize=8, stopbits=2, timeout=1)
print ser # returns [Serial<id=0x1cc7610, open=True>(port='/dev/ttyUSB0', baudrate=9600, bytesize=8, parity='N', stopbits=2, timeout=1, xonxoff=False, rtscts=False, dsrdtr=False)]

# see if the connection is truly open
print ser.isOpen() # prints True

# run the pump motor
ser.write(""RUN\r"")

Additional observations: when the instrument is plugged in but the above code is not running, the pump does all sorts of things at random (move one way, stop, move the other way, etc.). This behaviour is much less pronounce but still present when the code runs (and 'locks' the channel or something?). This seems to suggest that the reference voltages (logical high and low) are not properly set at 2-5V and 0-0.5V respectively

5116,How to find a solution for quadcopter PID control,"I've built a quadcopter and a rig to safely test it on. I'm working on the PID for controlling the roll pitch and yaw. I understand how a PID works on a more simple plant like say a robot with wheels and I'm just really in the dark ( i believe ) with controlling and stabilizing a quad.
My question, how do I make these sensor readings effectively alter the motors' throttle? 
Firstly, my approach is based on this model,  

My IMU calculates the roll and pitch as a value between +-1.0 where being perfect balance will read as 0.0.  Now a degree of +-1.0 means approximately 90 degrees from the original axis.
A normal input to the pitch to go forward would be something like 0.33, meaning tilt 30 degrees forward.
Now my motors take some value between 0 and 100. Originally I thought this would mean i would have to modify my motor values like so. 
c = throttle - roll + pitch + yaw
d = throttle + roll + pitch - yaw
b = throttle - roll - pitch - yaw
a = throttle + roll - pitch + yaw

Finally, I'm taking those floating point numbers, from the IMU and computing them like with this method, which appears to be the normal way as far as I've found.
RollPId.Compute( steering.roll - gyro.roll );  
// pid_t is either #define pid_t float    or double, I know its a reserved type but, a pre-processor definition will change that before it would matter. 
pid_t Compute(pid_t input) {
        uint64_t now = millis();
        if( ( now - last_time ) >= sample_time ) {
            pid_t error      = set_point - input;
            error_sum        += error;
            pid_t d_error    = error - error_last;

            *output = kp * error + ki * error_sum + kd * d_error;

            error_last = error;
            last_time  = now;
        }
    }

I don't know where to go from here? Also I have angular rate calculated from my IMU i just haven't encountered a solution that called for it. 
EDIT. Below is a graph of roughly 300 readings (20ms apart) so roughly six seconds where i hold it in one hand and roll it roughly 45degrees right. with kp=1 ki=0 kd=0

5130,PID for Quadcopters,"As already mentioned the PID output values that correspond to the error from the desirable error and current error has no units. Let's say we are using only the proportional part of the PID. Is it better to map the output of the PID values to the corresponding thrust values on each motor, or is it better to increase the Proportional coefficient  until the output values correspond to the proper thrust value to the motors? 
For example if my desired angle is 0 and the angle that the sensor is reading is 40 degrees the difference is multiplied by Kp and the output is added or subtracted from the current thrust depending on the motor.
If I increase Kp too much, then the quadcopter is oscillating and not listening to the controller command that I am sending for the desired degrees from the joystick. If I map the values then it is listening to the joystick commands and not oscillating so much. Why is this happening? Isn't mapping the PID output values to bigger values the same as increasing Kp?

I'm honest: I don't know where to start.

Reading the following interesting answer. But the problem here is: the trajectory has a PD controller with it. My quadrotor should take just a parametric curve as input.
OMPL: this library seems very powerful and interesting. It let the user to define a planner which many different algorithms. The problem is that it is not well documented, good examples and explanations are missing and till now I could'nt find anything related to quadrotors, which does use that library. There is an example for a quadrotor, which doesn't find my expectations and I cannot figure out, how to implement it in my package. I don't want just copy and paste code that I don't understand.
B-Spline and Bezier Curve...and the whole family of parametric curves. I found very interesting libraries in internet that implement those algorithm directly C++. The problem here is: I can define some points in space, generate a spline that contains them and interpolate points for the PID controller in the quadrotor. The basic idea is like a dog chasing a rabbit. A point is generated from the start point of the spline and regularly sent to the quadrotor. The latter flies behind the point, trying to reach it until a goal point has been reached. What is the problem here?!? In this case I can only generate a curve based on geometric properties and not considering the dynamic and the kinematic of the quadrotor (which I would consider for a future project). The rabbit runs and has a tighter curve radius than the dog, which could result in a strange behavior of the quadrotor.

I'd like same good tips to point to the right direction.
Which kind of trajectory planner are usually developed fr such an application?

The 1 HP motor is probably overkill for what I'm doing. I don't suppose I've ever used more than about 1/4 HP even on the toughest jobs. 
I'd appreciate any comments on my thinking so far: 
From what I've read, it looks as if a DC motor is the way to go (max torque at zero speed, which is nice for that initial ""punch through the material"" thing, and the ability to ""brake"" by shorting the + and - terminals). Brushless would be nice...but expensive. And I have a nice DC treadmill motor, and if I drive it at about 12-24V, it'll give me more or less the right speed; adjusting pulleys will do the rest. Such DC motors are powered (in electric lawnmowers, for instance) by running AC through a diode bridge rectifier to produce pulsating DC, and I've got such a bridge rectifier handy. I also have an old autotransformer that I can use to get 24VAC pretty easily. Thus I can get 24V pulsating DC to drive the thing ... but that may or may not be a good idea. 
I've also got an Arduino and the skills to program it, and several years of electronics tinkering, and some RC experience...but no experience handling larger DC motors like this one. I've been told the magic words ""H-bridge"", and found this motor driver which certainly seems as if it'll allow me to turn on/off the motor, and regulate the voltage going to the motor. I don't know whether, when presented with pulsating DC at the input, it'll still work. Any thoughts on this? 
I also can't tell -- there doesn't seem to be a handy datasheet or instruction page -- whether this thing can do braking. 
For position sensing, there are lots of places I can get information -- either from the needle baror the handwheel of the sewing machine, so I'm not too concerned about that part. To give a sense of the problem, a typical stitching speed is something like 1000 stiches per minute, so if I'm just sensing whether the needle is in the top 1/4 of its travels or the bottom quarter, we're talking about something on the order of 10-50Hz, which doesn't sound like a challenging control scenario. 
I guess my questions are these:

Will pulsating DC work with a controller like the one I've cited? 
Would I be better off with an RC motor-controller? I can't seem to find one designed for the 24V range that can handle 50 amps, unless it's for a brushless motor, which I don't have. And I think that I want one that has braking ability as well. And I worry that with an RC controller, the software in the controller may prevent me from making the motor stop at a particular position. 

Any comments/suggestions appreciated. (BTW, I'm happy with mathematics and with reading data sheets, and I've read (a few years ago) about half of ""The Art of Electronics"", just so you have an idea of the level of answer that's appropriate.) 
To answer @jwpat's questions:

I got my voltage value by saying that the motor is rated for (I think) 130V, and is 2.5HP (yikes), but turns at something like 6700 RPM. (Here's one that looks just like mine).  Dividing by 5 or 6, I got ""about 24 V"" to give me about 1400 RPM. (I'm at the office; the motor's at home, so I can't tell you the exact part number, alas.) I honestly don't think that the no-load vs load condition is a big deal, because I can wangle a factor of 2 with pulleys.

5201,How can I power a wheel but let it spin freely when not under power?,"How can I power a wheel but let it spin freely when not under power?
I saw the question How can I modify a low cost hobby servo to run 'freely'? but I'm more interested in knowing if there is some sort of gearbox that disengages ( moves to 'neutral' ) when no torque is being applied to it.
Two ideas that come to mind are:

A drive gear on a spring loaded arm with a nominal amount of resistance before engaging. Perhaps when under power it would first use power to move in one direction, then it would engage with another gear, but without power the spring would return it to a non-engaged position
A centrifugal clutch - although I'd like something that works at low RPMs as well

The idea is to create a small bot that can move up and down a track, but if someone interacts with it when not under power it will just roll and won't damage the gearbox.

5203,"Simple vector problem, Weight vector components & sine and cosine of rotation?","I have the quadcopter in the photo below. It has rotate  degrees about the -y axis. I want to get the x and z components in the local frame for the weight W which always points along the vertical downward.

We simply have:
Wx = W sin(theta); Wz = W cos(theta);

Suppose that W = 4N and theta = 30 deg, then:
Wx = -4 * sin(-30) = 2N;   Wz = -4 * cos(-30) = -3.464N

The negative sign in the angle was put because the rotation is about the -y axis (counterclockwise).
Wz seems correct as it is pointing towards the negative local z axis but Wx is 2 which seems wrong because according to the diagram it is supposed to be -2 indicating that it point towards the negative local x axis.
What's wrong with my simple calculation?
EDIT:

Using rotation matrices, we have the following rotation matrix when pitching (rotating about y axis):

This matrix is used to transform vectors from inertial frame Xn,Yn,Zn to local frame Xb,Yb,Zb. To find the components of the weight W, we can multiply this matrix by W. Doing so, we get the same result:

5251,Feedback controller: Is there any influence between outer and inner loop when running at different frequencies?,"I've develop a quadrotor (only simulation on my PC using ROS) and the feedback controller resumes more or less the following structure:

where you can think that process is the dynamic movement of the quadrotor (motion equations), the inner loop is the attitude controller (it just sets the orientation about all 3 axis) and the outer loop is the position controller that takes care where the quadrotor actually is. Why are they separated? Because in many papers I found out that the attitude controller (pitch, roll, yaw) need to run at higher frequency then any other controller in the system. The position controller instead needs to run at lower frequency.
The following picture is a better explanation of my description. Don't be scared...it is more simpler than one could think:

Now I did it as in the paper. BUT I discovered that my quadrotor was really unstable and I spent days and days trying to correct the gains of the controller without getting a stable system. My intuition said to me that maybe they are running at wrong frequency, so I put a different frequency values for the position controller being sure it is not a multiply of the main frequency (something like 1000Hz and 355 Hz for example.)
Lately I removed the timer in my program (C++) and let the position controller run at the same frequency as the attitude controller just because I run out of ideas and suddenly worked everything nice.

I'm looking for my next simulator development: a Tanker is flying at constant speed (350 Knots) (no acceleration, no change of altitude or direction). The Tanker is approached from behind by a UAV which needs to refuel or transfer data through a wire. The UAV knows the direction, the speed and relative position from the tanker in order to approach it smoothly. It knows that at about 5 m from the tanker is the contact successful.
Here a picture I found on internet but it is clear more than thousand words:

To achieve the task I thought to implement a ""simple"" PID which controls the position and the velocity, but for this I have in my mind two different designs approaches:

Solution one: the motion equation of my system provide the position $x,y,z$ and velocity $Vx, Vy, Vz$ of the UAV (to simplify things I will consider just $x$ but of course $y,z$ must be eventually considered too). Those are feedback with the desired position (5m) and velocity (350 Knots) of the tanker. The feedback line is separated for each state and PIDs are working quite indipendently as in the following picture:


please note that to simplify things I never considered the acceleration.

Solution two: this is the most tricky one and I was yesterday thinking about it all the time. In this case only one state vector is going to be feedback to the desired setpoints. In this case I would feedback only the velocity then integrate it and feed the result into the second PID. Maybe the following picture is clearer:


But here I'm not really sure if the second idea is conceptually wrong or could be affordable. I'm pretty sure that the first one is working and leads to good result, but I was wondering if the second one is affordable or is not recommended for a control design.

I imagine that once the starting point and target destination on a given map are set, a self driving follows an algorithm that loops through certain operations to solve certain problems along the way.  I'm more interested in knowing what those problems are specifically at a high level, rather than detailed algorithms to solve them.  Do all self driving cars solve the same subproblems along the way?

5310,Interfacing high-resolution image sensors with ARM Board,"I'm working on a project requiring HD (Stereo) Video Processing. Most of High Resolution (5MP+) Sensors use MIPI-CSI interface. 
I managed to get a board with an Exynos5 SoC. The SoC Itself has 2 MIPI-CSI2 interfaces, the problem is that the pins to those interfaces are not exposed and It's (almost) impossible to reach them. So I decided to use the USB3.0 Buses.
The problem is when I get to Significant bandwidth (~5.36 Gibibits/s per sensor), I don't think USB3.0 will work out.  but this could be solved with a Compressed stream (via a coprocessor)
I was thinking that Cypress' CYUSB306X chip was a good candidate for the job, but one of the problems is that I can't do BGA Soldering by hand nor have been able to find a BGA Soldering Service in Switzerland.
Any Ideas on other interfaces I could implement or other coprocessors with MIPI-CSI2 Interface?

I have followed this tutorial for getting ttyO4 open on the BBB and used the following command on to set the serial line correctly: 
wiring is set up according to this tutorial. 
    stty -F /dev/ttyO4 cs8 9600 ignbrk -brkint -imaxbel -opost -onlcr -isig -icanon -iexten -echo -echoe -echok -echoctl -echoke noflsh -ixon -crtscts
next data is sent using the following method: 

the arduino uses the followingvoid loop(){
 code to check for serial communication:
#include <SPI.h>

void setup(){ //////////////SETUP///////////////////////
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop(){
      if(Serial.available()>=4){
         digitalWrite(12, HIGH);
         delay(1000);               // wait for a second
         digitalWrite(12, LOW);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
         delay(1000);               // wait for a second
         digitalWrite(12, HIGH);
         byte b1,b2,b3,b4; 
         b1=Serial.read();
         }
    }
}

However it seems no message is received. It does not give any error either. 
As an alternative I have also tried a variant of the code suggested in the wiring tutorial resulting in the following code:
import sys
from bbio import *


Serial2.begin(9600)
for arg in sys.argv:
    print arg
    Serial2.write(arg)
    delay(5)

called with pyton test s123 this printed s123 but the arduino remained silent. 
Edit I have now also tried to exactly follow the wiring tutorial so that gave me the following sketch: 
char inData[20]; // Allocate some space for the string
char inChar=-1; // Where to store the character read
byte index = 0; // Index into array; where to store the character

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);   // digital sensor is on digital pin 2
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(2000);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  delay(500);
}

{
  Serial.write(""A"");
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  delay(100);
  if (Comp(""A"")==0) {
      digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
      delay(1000);
      digitalWrite(13, LOW);
      delay(500);
  }
}

char Comp(char* This) {
    while (Serial.available() > 0) // Don't read unless
                                   // there you know there is data
    {
        if(index < 19) // One less than the size of the array
        {
            inChar = Serial.read(); // Read a character
            inData[index] = inChar; // Store it
            index++; // Increment where to write next
            inData[index] = '\0'; // Null terminate the string
        }
    }

    if (strcmp(inData,This)  == 0) {
        for (int i=0;i<19;i++) {
            inData[i]=0;
        }
        index=0;
        return(0);
    }
    else {
        return(1);
    }
}

and on the BBB we turn on the echo script with
/PyBBIO/examples$ sudo python serial_echo.py

The effect remains that there is no error but also no data delivery.

6315,"Pose estimation, how to populate set of known edges and points?","I am building an estimator that solves for the camera pose relative to a reference frame which contains a known set of features and edges. Currently, the system works with an unscented kalman filter with four known points (red leds) in the reference frame. I am now hoping to improve robustness by adding edges to the model as well as robust features. I would like to add additional points that are uncovered by some opencv feature finding function (fast,cornerHarris,...).
So far I found the paper ""Fusing Points and Lines for High Performance Tracking"" and ""Robust Extended Kalman Filtering For Camera Pose Tracking Using 2D to 3D Lines Correspondences"" which seem to detail how to fuse edge and feature matching for pose estimation.
Is there a strategy to populate the known set of edges and features when it is impractical to measure them with a ruler/tape measure? My first thought is to start with a small known set of features, my red leds, then run some slam algorithm and keep all features/edges that have some minimum certainty.
Thanks a bunch!
I have misunderstood the RANSAC algorithm. This is not appropriate for my application.

6325,Ambiguous definition of Error-State (Indirect) Kalman Filter,"I am confused by what precisely the term ""Indirect Kalman Filter"" or ""Error-State Kalman Filter"" means.
The most plausible definition I found is in Maybeck's book [1]:

As the name indicates, in the total state space (direct) formulation, total states
  such as vehicle position and velocity are among the state variables in the filter,
  and the measurements are INS accelerometer outputs and external source
  signals. In the error state space (indirect) formulation, the errors in the INS-
  indicated position and velocity are among the estimated variables, and each
  measurement presented to the filter is the difference between INS and external
  source data.

20 years later Roumeliotis et al. in [2] write:

The cumbersome modeling of the specific vehicle and its interaction with a dynamic environment is avoided by selecting gyro modeling instead. The gyro signal appears in the system (instead of the measurement) equations and thus the formulation of the problem requires an Indirect (error-state) Kalman filter approach.

I cannot understand the bold part, since Lefferts et al. in [3] write much earlier:

For autonomous spacecraft the use of inertial reference units as a model
  replacement permits the circumvention of these problems.

And then proceed to show different variants of EKFs using gyro modeling that are clearly direct Kalman Filters according to Maybeck's definition: The state only consists of the attitude quaternion and gyro bias, not error states. In fact, there is no seperate INS whose error to estimate with an error-state Kalman filter. 
So my questions are:

Is there a different, maybe newer definition of indirect (error-state) Kalman Filters I am not aware of?
How are gyro modeling as opposed to using a proper dynamic model on the one hand and the decision whether to use a direct or indirect Kalman filter on the other hand related? I was under the impression that both are independent decisions.

Here are my questions:

Everything will work on battery. I can get a 3.3V and 5V supply from a 9V battery using L1117-3.3V and 7805 regulators respectively. I know that it's not at all reliable to share the power source of the control circuitry with high load devices like motors and servos. Should I have a dedicated separate supplies for electromechanical components and the control circuitry?
Servo will run on 6V supply and motor will run on a 12V supply. How should I go about this one? Again, separate batteries for servo and motors?
Can of this work on a single high capacity battery, somewhat like 10000mAh?

Here are some of my calculations:
Servo current (6V): at no load: ~450mA, at around 6kg load: ~800mA
Motor current (12V): at no load: ~500mA, at around 6kg load: ~950mA
RaspberryPi and other digital circuitry (5V + 3.3V): ~600mA (that includes an Xbee)
Thus, the overall current at a 6kg load (with two motors) comes around ~3.3A

Example:
For this example the P loop was run every 33-36 milliseconds.
I will tell the motor to go to 250 deg/sec, and it will go to 275 deg/sec, the P loop then reacts by lowering the value sent to the motor however the speed then increase to 400 deg/sec and then the P loop lowers the value again, then the speed will drop to 34 deg/sec.

I use the pointgrey_camera_driver  for obtaining the images from the camera. The head has 2 degrees of freedom (up/down, left/right). I am intending to use this camera with the ar_pose package to detect and track AR tags on objects. I understand that camera's must be calibrated for effective use (forgive me, I don't know much about camera) which I do with the camera_calibration package.
My question is: Since this camera is ""mobile"" meaning since the head can move so does the camera, how would I go about calibrating it? Currently, I have the head fixed at a position and I've calibrated the camera in that position and got the parameters in the yaml file which I can load for rectification. In particular, if the head moves does the calibration file that I obtained in the previous position become invalid? If so, as asked before, how would I calibrate this camera for all of its possible field's of view (which can be obtained by moving)?
This camera has different video modes and in the mode I'm using I can get a frame rate of 21Hz (i.e. after driver is launched I get 21Hz for rostopic hz /camera/image_raw). However, when I rectify the image using image_proc, I get a frame rate of only about 3Hz on rostopic hz /camera/image_rect_color. Is this normal? Is there a way for me to increase this frame rate?

6398,Eliminating Electrical Noise from my motor driver,"Background:
I am using an Arduino Mega connected to a RoboClaw 2x60A motor driver.  I asked this question about the system, but I have since narrowed the scope of the problem.  I tried adding a bunch of different size capacitor between the 5v and gnd, when the RoboClaw is switched off then a 470 micro farad capacitor seems to eliminate all noise but when I turn on the RoboClaw no capacitance valued I tried, (4.7,10,100,220,320,470,540,690,1000,1100)microfarads seems to eliminate any noise.  I even tried hooking up a 12v battery with a 5v regulator to the logic battery on the RoboClaw and connecting it to the ground on the Arduino.  Then I tried using a separate battery for the pots and connecting the AREF to the +5v on the battery.
No matter what I try when the roboclaw is on the potentiometer value will vary as much as +-6 degrees.  I found the degrees using:
map(analogRead(A0),0,1023,0,300) 
In addition I took a bunch of data and graphed it and found that if I took 25 instantaneous data points and averaged them together it would help significantly reduce the variance.  I chose 25 because it take 2.9 ms, 100 worked really well but it took 11 ms.  To help explain the averageing of analog read, here is my code:
unsigned int num = 0;
for (int i = 0; i<25; i++){

}
potReading = num/25;
My Question:
What is my next step in eliminating this noise?  Is there a formula I can use to find a better capacitance value? Should I try putting capacitors on each potentiometer between 5V and gnd?  Any other IC I should try to help with this?  On my previous question someone mentioned optocouplers, what size would work best and where in the circuit do they go?  Is there code I can write to help eliminate the size of the variance beyond what I have written?

My question is can I control a Rambo V1.2 board from either of these programs? These programs don't include explicit support for the RAMBo as far as I can see, but maybe I'm missing how printing software works at this point?

What is a RAMBo?
The RAMBo V1.2 board is a creative-commons/open source design. It integrates an Arduino, Stepper-Motor drivers, Heater & Fan controls, Power Management and more.
An example implementation looks like this:

For more background info on what a RAMBo board is, you may read about it on the RepRap community wiki.

6418,Tracking Landspeed Underwater,"I am hoping someone might be able to nudge me in the right direction (apologies for the long post but wanted to get all the information I have gained so far down.
Basically I am after a solution to record the path my vessel took under water for later analysislike a bread crumb trail.
Requirements:
Ideally have a range of at least 30meters however if there were no other options I would accept down to 10meters.
Working fresh and salt water.
The vessel is (25cm x 8cm) so size and power consumption are a factors.
It would be traveling roughly parallel to the sea bed at variable distances from the sea bed (range of 0-30 meters)
Does not need to be super accurate, anything less than 5 meters would be fine.
Measurement speed range of 0  4 mph.
Measure direction the object was moving in (i.e. forwards, sideways, backwards)I am planning to use a compass to ascertain N, S, E, W heading.
Options I have discounted:

Accelerometers:

This was my initial thinking but in doing some reading it seems they are not suited to my needs (unless you spend loads of money, and then the solution would end up being too heavy anyway).

Optical Flow:

Looks too new (from a consumer perspective) / complicated. I dont know what its range would be like. Also requires additional sonar sensor.
Current favorites:

Sonar:


Simplest use is distance from object, however can use doppler effect to analyse speed of a moving object.
40m range, nice!
Presumptions:
If I fired this at an angle to the seabed I could deduce the speed the floor was moving below which would give me the speed of my vessel?
I am also presuming that I could interpret direction of movement from the data?
I presume that the sensor would need to be aimed at an angle of around 45 degrees down to the seabed?

Laser Rangefinder:

Although it works differently to the Sonar the premise of use looks the same, and thus I have the same queries with this as I do with the Sonar above.
Presume if I mounted the sensor behind high quality glass (to waterproof it) then performance would not be impacted that much.
This is a lot more costly so if it does not give me any advantage over sonar I guess there is no point.

Water Flow Meter:


Super low cost and simple compared with the other options, I would potentially use a funnel to increase water pressure if it needs more sensitivity at low speed.
Would then just need to calibrate the pulses from the sensor to a speed reading.
Significant limitations of this is it would be registering a speed of 0 if the vessel was simply drifting with the current.its speed over the seabed that I am interested in.
Current favorite option is sonar (with the option of using water flow meter as second data source)however are my sonar presumptions correct, have I missed anything?
Any better ideas?

6423,Particle filter weight function,"I am trying to implement a particle filter in MATLAB to filter a robot's movement in 2D but I'm stuck at the weight function. My robot is detected by a camera via two points, so a single measure is a quadruple (, yp1, xp2, yp2) and states are the usual (x,y,alpha) to detect its pose in 2D. As far as my understanding goes I should assign a weight to each particle based on its likelihood to be in that particle position with regards to the current measurement.
I also have the measure function to calculate an expected measurement for a particle, so basically I have, for each instant, the actual measurement and the measurement that a single particle would have generated if it were at the actual state. 
Assuming all noises are Gaussian, how can I implement the weight function? I kind of noticed the mvnpdf function in MATLAB, but I can't actually find a way to apply it to my problem.

6434,differential robot yaw estimation using kalman filter,"Hello i am building a differential drive robot which is equipped with quadrature encoders on both of the motors. My aim is to be able to predict the heading (yaw angle) of the robot using a kalman filter. I am using an MPU 9150 imu. As of now m just interested in yaw angle and not the roll/pitch. As i understand, i will be needing the z-axis of gyro to be fused with the magnetometer data in order to properly estimate the heading angle. My problem is how do i implement the bias and covariance required for the kalman filter to work. Gyroscope would be my process and magnetometer data would be my update step yeah?. From the datasheet i have found the Angular random walk of my gyroscope to be 0.3 degrees/second for 10 Hz motion bandwidth and a constant bias of 20 degrees/second at room temperature. If i am not mistaken i should include the bias in my state prediction equation?. Also how do i get the covariance matrix Q.

6436,Choosing a WiFi antenna for outdoor robot,"A time has come for my robot to get some more permanent computer than my laptop balanced on top of it.
I have selected a mini itx board that can be powered directly from battery and some components that go with it including a wifi card and now I'm thinking about the antenna I will need.
Constraints I have identified so far:

The robot's body is a closed aluminium box, so I think this rules out keeping the antenna inside.
The robot is intended to work outdoors, so it needs to be waterproof.
Vibrations might be an issue.

And the questions:

What parameters should I watch when selecting an antenna?
Is it ok to use indoor stick antenna and seal the mounting point with hot glue?
Does it change anything if the antenna will be sticking out of largish sheet of alluminium?
The robot will also have GPS, is it possible that the two will interact badly under some circumstances?

6442,Quadcopter multiple ESC angles glitch,"I'm developing my fligth controller board on Tiva Launchpad for quadcoper and while calibrating PID I discovered an unexpected behaviour: sometimes quadcopter seems to experience random angle errors. While trying to investigate it, I've figured out that my code if fairly trying to compensate tham, as soon as they appear - but do not cause them. Even more - i've discovered that such behaviour appears only when two (or more) motors are adjusted, while one motor system shows pretty good stabilisation.
Here is code for PMW output for different motors:

and here is recorded angles for system with one motor and two motors:

To be sure that it's not the algorithm problem, while recording this angles only Integral part of PID was non-zero, so angles were not even stabilised.
My question is - could esc noise each other (in my quad they are quite close to each other - just few sentimeters away) to cause such behaviour?

6445,Ways of reversing motor direction easily,"My set up consists of a brushed motor (ex cordless drill type) connected to a motor controller which is in turn connected to a LIPO battery and an r/c receiver. All my cables are fitted with XT 60 connectors except for the cable that goes to the receiver which is a 3 wire pin (usual white, red and black).
The above set up is one of a pair which I am using in my battle robot. The motors are connected to drive wheels, left and right respectively. the problem is the motors are turning in opposing directions.
For some reason I neglected to switch the polarity of the wires of one  motor at the time I attached the XT 60 connectors and I really am not looking forward to re-soldering.  
So my question is whether there is any fast way of reversing the direction of rotation without soldering?  For instance can the R/C transmitter (a turnigy 9x without any modding)be programmed to switch up for down (hence forward for reverse)? 
Or can I maybe switch the pin connector going into the receiver (I don't think so because the ground is probably common, but worth asking just in case I guess). 
Any ideas or should I just get soldering?

The car as it is now, has a camera installed on each side of the car, i.e. 4 cameras in total. They are connected to a board which is able to read and process the video input.
I have been researching about obstacle detection using a single camera (without stereo cameras, e.g. Single camera vision and mapping system ) and although it seems possible it also seems quite complex. Modifying the cameras set-up is not an option.

If the first approach is not feasible, as an alternative option I also could install distance sensors in the car to detect obstacles.

In the closed position, no power is available. (i.e. The closure mechanism needs to be 100% passive.)
In order to keep this open for some time, I will need a motor that is capable of being stalled for long periods without having the windings burn up. I know some motors can do this, such as the motors they use on spring closed HVAC dampers, but I don't know how to find them or if there's a particular name I should be using to find them. I know I could probably do this with a stepper motor, but that seems overkill for the application.

6575,How to distribute tension load on a three footed claw?,"Good day!  
I am helping my little ones 6 and 7 to develop a robot that can pick up and stack cubes three high as well as gather blocks.  They came up with the design that enables them to pick up three cubes at a time when lined up and then pull up the claw, turn, drive to another cube, place the cubes on the stand still cube and release.
   Well they got the claw made with two rods connected to gears to motor and the rods reinforced, then they made insect like legs 3 - pairs of two on the rods, with gripper feet pads on the ends of the legs. All of this works as it opens and closes! The problem is that when they try to close the claw on the cubes and pick up all three cubes, the first - closest to motor feet have a nice tight grip, the second - middle feet - have a lighter grip and just barely can lift the block, and third - farthest from motor doesn't even have a grip on the blocks.
   I think it's because the second and third set of feet are farther from the motor. But how can they evenly disperse the tension load so the claw can pick up all three blocks?
I tried putting elastics on the feet for better grip and unless we put ten on each foot for the third set and maybe five on the second set it wont work.  Even though it's a quick fix I would like to help them figure it out the proper way of spreading the load so to speak.  We also tried putting a small band on the third set of legs.  The robot could still open and close and that worked for the third set but not the second.  We tried putting a band on the second and third but the legs wouldn't open anymore.  I could use a lighter band but is there another way? We only have one little motor to run it so we can't give all the leg sets it's own motor and even if we did there would be weight issues.
  THank you in advance!

But now I am at a point where I have Python code which is supposed to rotate a servo through Pololu's Maestro Serial servo controller (). Based on the ""Serial Interface"" section of the user's guide (), I sent a sequence of numbers starting with decimal 170 and 12, which are the ""first command byte"" and the ""device number data byte"", respectively. The user guide says that 12 is the default device number, so I tried changing it to 18 because that's how many servos my servo controller can drive. But that doesn't make much difference because the servo doesn't rotate at all. The numbers after that are the same as the example from the user's guide. I am not sure what the 4, 112 and 46 are doing, but the 0 targets the servo port ""0"" on the servo controller (the port to which my servo is connected). The servo doesn't move, regardless of what sequence of numbers I put in.

6613,Multiple limbs on small robots,"Note: I'm a firmware developer experienced with sensors and networks, but not much with motors.
I am trying to build a small hobby robot, like a cat-sized spider. I am thinking of using servo motors with position control, so I don't have to use encoders to know where the motor is. Assuming six legs (I know, spiders have eight), with each leg being able to move up-down and left-right, that already translates to 12 motors. If you want to bend a knee, that gets the number to 18.
18 motors on such a small robot is overkill, isn't it?
I have thought of a couple of ideas, but not having a strong mechanical background, I cannot tell whether they are doable/sane.
One of my ideas is to use a magnet on the end of the limb (the end inside the chassis) and a small permanent magnet above it. The magnets attract each other and this keeps the limb firm under the weight of the robot. A stronger controllable magnet (a coil) would attract the limb even more and let it lift in the air. The following drawing may help:

This would allow the up-down movement of the leg, and a servo would control its left-right movement. However, I fear that such a system would not be strong enough to hold under the weight of the robot, or whether a reasonable coil would be compact enough.
In short, my question is, how can I control six legs each with two or three degrees of freedom with a reasonable number of motors? Is having one motor per degree of freedom the only possibility?

6617,Jacobian-based trajectory following,"I would like to control my 7 DOF robot arm to move along a Cartesian trajectory in the world frame.  I can do this just fine for translation, but I am struggling on how to implement something similar for rotation.  So far, all my attempts seem to go unstable.  
The trajectory is described as a translational and rotational velocity, plus a distance and/or timeout stopping criteria.  Basically, I want the end-effector to move a short distance relative to its current location.  Because of numerical errors, controller errors, compliance, etc, the arm won't be exactly where you wanted it from the previous iteration.  So I don't simply do $J^{-1}v_e$.  Instead, I store the pose of the end-effector at the start, then at every iteration I compute where the end-effector should be at the current time, take the difference between that and the current location, then feed that into the Jacobian.
I'll first describe my translation implementation.  Here is some pseudo OpenRave Python:

The rotation is a little trickier.  To determine the desired rotation at the current time, i use Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP).  OpenRave provides a quatSlerp() function which I use.  (It requires conversion into quaternions, but it seems to work).  Then I calculate the relative rotation between the current pose and the target rotation.  Finally, I convert to Euler angles which is what I must pass into my AngularVelocityJacobian.  Here is the pseudo code for it.  These lines are inside the while loop:
rot_t1 = np.dot(pose_start[:3,:3], velocity_transform[:3,:3]) # desired rotation of end-effector 1 second from start
quat_start = quatFromRotationMatrix(pose_start) # start pose as quaternion
quat_t1 = quatFromRotationMatrix(rot_t1) # rot_t1 as quaternion

# use SLERP to compute proper rotation at this time
quat_target = quatSlerp(quat_start, quat_t1, t_elapsed) # world_to_target
rot_target = rotationMatrixFromQuat(quat_target) # world_to_target
v_rot = np.dot(np.linalg.inv(pose_current[:3,:3]), rot_target) # current_to_target
v_euler = eulerFromRotationMatrix(v_rot) # get rotation about world axes

Then v_euler is fed into the Jacobian along with v_trans.  I am pretty sure my Jacobian code is fine.  Because i have given it (constant) rotational velocities ok.  
Note, I am not asking you to debug my code.  I only posted code because I figured it would be more clear than converting this all to math.  I am more interested in why this might go unstable.  Specifically, is the math wrong?  And if this is completely off base, please let me know.  I'm sure people must go about this somehow. 
So far, I have been giving it a slow linear velocity (0.01 m/s), and zero target rotational velocity.  The arm is in a good spot in the workspace and can easily achieve the desired motion.  The code runs at 200Hz, which should be sufficiently fast enough.  
I can hard-code the angular velocity fed into the Jacobian instead of using the computed v_euler and there is no instability.  So there is something wrong in my math.  This works for both zero and non-zero target angular velocities.  Interestingly, when i feed it an angular velocity of 0.01 rad/sec, the end-effector rotates at a rate of 90 deg/sec.
Update: If I put the end-effector at a different place in the workspace so that its axes are aligned with the world axes, then everything seems works fine.  If the end-effector is 45 degrees off from the world axes, then some motions seem to work, while others don't move exactly as they should, although i don't think i've seen it go unstable.  At 90 degrees or more off from world, then it goes unstable.

6639,how to plot $\pm 3 \sigma$ of a landmark in EKF-SLAM,"I have implemented 2D-SLAM using EKF. The map is based-feature in which there is only one landmark for the sake of simplicity. I've read some papers regarding this matter. They plot the $\pm3\sigma$ plus the error. I would like to make sure that I'm doing the right thing. In my project, I have the estimate of the landmark's position and its true values. The true values here are the ones that the sensor measure not the ideal case. For example, the ideal case of the landmark position  is (30,60) but this value is not accessible by any means, therefore I will consider the true values the ones that are coming from the sensor. 
Now the error in the landmark's position in x-axis is formulated as follows 
$$
\text{error}_{x} = \hat{x} - x
$$
The below picture shows the error in blue color. The red color represents the error bounds which is $\pm 3 \sigma_{x}$

6642,"""Time-varying"" and ""nonautonomous"" dynamical systems and their Lyapunov analysis","It is possible to distinguish the properties ""time-varying"" and ""nonautonomous"" in dynamical systems regarding Lyapunov stability analysis?
Does it make a difference if the system depends explicitly on $t$ or indirectly on $t$ due to a time-varying parameter?
I want to explain the problem in detail:
Let a dynamical system denoted by $\dot x = f$, with state $x$.
We say that a dynamical system is nonautonomous if the dynamics $f$ depend on time $t$, i.e. $$\dot x = f(t,x).$$
For instance the systems $$ \dot x = - t x^2 $$ and $$ \dot x = -a(t)x,$$ are nonautonomous. Let $a(t)$ be a bounded time-varying parameter, i.e. $||a(t)||<a^+$ and strictly positive, i.e. $a(t) > 0$. 
Particularly, the second example is more likely denoted as a time-varying linear system, but of course it is nonautonomous. 
In Lyapunov stability analysis autonomous and nonautonomous systems must be strongly distinguished to make assertions about stability of the system, and the Lyapunov analysis for nonautonomuos systems is much more difficult.
And here for me some questions arise. When i want to analize stability of the second example must i really use the Lyapunov theory for nonautonomous systems? 
It follows for the candidate $V = 1/2 x^2$
$$\dot V = -a(t)x^2,$$
which is negative definite. Is the origin really asymptotically stable, as i suppose, or must i take the nonautomous characteristic into account in this case?
I would suppose it makes a difference if a system depends explicitly on $t$ as in the first example or just indirect due to a time-varying parameter, since $t$ approaches infinity, but a parameter does not.

6651,Are robotic pollenators being designed?,"With the bee hive collapses, growers are desperate for pollenation options. Is anyone working on swarms of tiny flying robots to augment the bees? They could look for a certain color, poke around inside the flower for a moment, and move on to the next. When they need recharging, they fly back to their hive (the same reason bees fly back). 
Of course, replacing germinators that run the seeds through their digestive systems would be a different problem.

6659,GraphSLAM: why are constraints imposed twice in the information matrix?,"I was watching Sebastian Thrun's video course on AI for robotics (freely available on udacity.com).  In his final chapter on GraphSLAM, he illustrates how to setup the system of equations for the mean path locations $x_i$ and landmark locations $L_j$.
To setup the matrix system, he imposes each robot motion and landmark measurement constraint twice.  For example, if a robot motion command is to move from x1 by 5 units to the right (reaching x2), i understand this constraint as
$$-x_2+x_1= -5$$
However, he also imposes the negative of this equation 
$$x_2-x_1=5$$
as a constraint and superimposes it onto a different equation and i'm not sure why.  In his video course, he briefly mentions that the matrix we're assembling is known as the ""information matrix"", but i have no why the information matrix is assembled in this specific way.
So, I tried to read his book Probabilistic Robotics, and all i can gather is that these equations come from obtaining the minimizer of the negative log posterior probability incorporating the motion commands, measurements, and map correspondences, which results in a quadratic function of the unknown variables $L_j$ and $x_i$.  Since it is quadratic (and the motion / measurement models are also linear), the minimum is obviously obtained by solving a linear system of equations.
But why are each of the constraints imposed twice, with once as a positive quantity and again as the negative of the same equation?  Its not immediately obvious to me from the form of the negative log posterior probability (i.e. the quadratic function) that the constraints must be imposed twice.  Why is the ""information matrix assembled this way?  Does it also hold true when the motion and measurement models are nonlinear?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

6661,FreeIMU External Magnetometer,"I have been using the FreeIMU library successfully but now I want to add an external magnetometer that I can mount away from my motors.
I've figured out how to modify the FreeIMU library to use an external magnetometer and I am getting data.
What I can't figure out is what I need to change now that my magnetometer orientation has changed.
On the free IMU it is mounted like this 

The external compass is mounted like this - upside down - rotated 180 around x

I am changing the value inside the 

function as all the other code calls this to get the magnetometer data.
So far I have tried:

Changing the sign for the y and z values after I have got them from the magnetometer.
Changing the sign for the y value only
Changing the sign for the z value only
Added 180 to both the y and z values
Subtracting 180 from both the y and z values
Subtracting 180 from y and adding 180 to Z
Adding 180 to y and subtracting 180 from z
Changing nothing

The calibration GUI gives always gives me strange results, and doing the changes above just rotated/mirrored the magnetometer red and green graphs. I am unable to get rid of the key hole shape.

The red is XY. The green YZ. The blue is ZX. Does the fact that ZX works mean that my issue is with the Y value?
This is how it looks using the on board magnetometer.

What should I try next?
Thanks
Joe
EDIT
I tried rotating the external magnetometer so it is in the same orientation as the FreeIMU magnetometer and I still get the same result so I don't think its the difference in orientation that is causing the problem.
So then I thought maybe its because the FreeIMU is mounted central to the rotation axis and the external magnetometer is mounted about 20cm above. I tested this by rotating only the external magnetometer around itself and I still got the same result. 
This is all seems strange, do you think its possible that the external magnetometer I have brought is faulty? Any way to confirm it is working properly on its own?
Thanks
EDIT
Managed to get circles plotting by changing the gain from 0 to 1. It seem my new magnetometer was being saturated.
Now I just need to work out how to change my values around so the orientation is correct.

6662,How to track robot position,"I'm a software researcher, who in my spare time mentors a robotics team, helping on the software side of things.  For years, I keep coming back to the same question.  How to determine the robots position, and heading during our competitions.  We have tried a number of things with varying degrees of success/failure. Encoders on the drive wheels, accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc.  I recently bought an IMU with a 3 axis accelerometer, 3 axis gyro, and 3 axis magnetometer, all preprocessed by an Arduino, and outputting the value to a serial port.  I thought surely there must be a way to take all these measurements, and get a composite view of position and heading.  We are using mechanum wheels on this particular robot, so wheel encoders are not particularly useful.  I've looked around and there's a lot of talk about orientation using quaternion with sensor fusion using similar boards, but it very unclear to me how to take the quaternion and the estimation and come up with x,y distance from the starting position.  Now my time window for these measurements is small, ~15 seconds, but I need it to be pretty accurate within that window.  I'm about ready to abandon using the IMU, and try something else.  One idea is to use a usb ball mouse to try and track robot motion but I'm certain that the mouse is going to get banged around way too much leading to noise and invalid results.  As a side note: robot's about 2ft x 3ft base weighting in at 120 lbs.  Any thoughts or suggestions appreciated.

6672,The uncertainty is big while the sensor is rather accurate at measuring a landmark in EKF-SLAM,"I've a 2D sensor which provides a range $r$ and a bearing $\phi$ to a landmark. In my 2D EKF-SLAM simulation, the sensor has the following specifications 
$$
\sigma_{r} = 0.01 \text{m} \ \ ,\sigma_{\phi} = 0.5 \ \text{deg}
$$ 
The location of the landmark in x-axis is 30. EKF imposes the Gaussian noise, therefore the location of the landmark is represented via two quantities namely the mean $\mu_{x}$ and the variance $\sigma_{x}$. In the following graph 

The green is the mean $\mu_{x}$ which is very close to the true location (i.e. 30). The black is the measurements and red is $\mu_{x} \pm 3 \sigma_{x}$. I don't understand why the uncertainty is big while I'm using rather accurate sensor. The process noise for the robot's pose is $\sigma_{v} = 0.001$ which is small noise. I'm using C++. 

Edit: for people who ask about the measurements, this is my code 
$$
r = \sqrt{ (m_{j,y} - y)^{2} + (m_{j,x} - x)^{2}} + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{r}^{2}) \\
\phi = \text{atan2} \left( \frac{m_{j,y} - y}{m_{j,x} - x} \right) + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\phi}^{2})
$$

where Normalized_Gaussain_Noise_Generator() is ( i.e. $\mathcal{N}(0, 1) )$
double Robot::Normalized_Gaussain_Noise_Generator()
{
    double noise;
    std::normal_distribution<double> distribution;
    noise = distribution(generator);

    return noise;
}

For the measurements (i.e. the black color), I'm using the inverse measurement function  given the estimate of the robot's pose and the true measurement in polar coordinates to get the location of a landmark. The actual approach is as follows 
$$
\bar{\mu}_{j,x} = \bar{\mu}_{x} + r \cos(\phi + \bar{\mu}_{\theta}) \\
\bar{\mu}_{j,y} = \bar{\mu}_{y} + r \sin(\phi + \bar{\mu}_{\theta})
$$
This is how it is stated in the Probabilistic Robotics book. This means that the measurements in the above graph are indeed the predicted measurements not the true ones. 
Now under same conditions, the true measurements can be obtained as follows
$$
\text{m}_{j,x} = x + r \cos(\phi + \theta) \\
\text{m}_{j,y} = y + r \sin(\phi + \theta)
$$
The result is in the graph below, which means there is no correlations between the true measurements and the robot's estimate. This leads me to the same question - why the uncertainty behaves like that?

I've tuned my parameters on numerical simulations based on a continuous inverted pendulum system so that the simulated inverted pendulum balances by controlling the horizontal (linear) cart acceleration $\ddot{x}$.
Now that I've done this, I want to take the next step and turn my PID control commands into electrical commands onto a DC motor to give the desired linear acceleration $\ddot{x}$. However I'm not sure how exactly to do this for my specific robot's motors.  Are there experimental tests should I run to determine how to convert PID commands into DC motor acceleration commands? Or is there a formula to do this based on the motor's specifications?
Update
The non-linear dynamic equation I'm using is
$$L\ddot{\theta}=gsin(\theta)+\ddot{x}(t)cos(\theta)+Ld(t)$$
where $\ddot{x}(t)$ is the linear acceleration, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\ddot{\theta}$ is the angular acceleration, and $d(t)$ is an external disturbance to the system. To simplify things, I've linearized the equations around $\theta\approx0$, yielding
$$L\ddot{\theta}=g\theta+\ddot{x}(t)+Ld(t)$$
I've assumed that the only control input is the cart's linear acceleration $\ddot{x}(t)$, and chose this control command as $\ddot{x}(t)=K_1\theta(t) + K_2\int_0^t\theta(t) dt + K_3\dot{\theta}$, where $K_i$ are the PID gains.

In addition two of the motors seem like they are lagging when I turn the quadcopter fast in one direction. Also for some strange reason the quadcopter seems less responsive to P gain; I have it at 20 in the C++ version and it is working about the same as when I had it at 1.5 in the java version.
Edit:
After doing some more testing I have determined that reading from the MPU6050 and writing to the PCA9685 board that I am using to control the ESCs is the source of the delay. Does anybody know how to speed this up?
Edit:
I managed to speed up my code to about 200 Hz by changing the i2c baud rate, but the quadcopter is still thrashing. I have spent hours trying to tune the pid controller, but it doesn't seem to help at all.

We couldn't figure out a possible mechanism that could collect the balls and drop them into the trailer except for a robot arm. However, we don't have experience and time in designing a sophisticated system for the arm like recognizing where the ball is and then grabbing it accordingly.

The IMU is reading the angle of the quad, calculating motor commands by using a PID controller and applying them to the motors. It works well when constrained in a test bed, however in reality, although the quad is straight and level, it's drifting to one side because of its recent motor commands correcting the pitch/yaw. Is there any way I can (without using a vision system) keep the quad in one place without drifting?

6741,How many methods can I use to acquire depth data?,"I am a newbie in Robotics. As far as I know, there're generally two ways to acquire depth information of a scene. One is the stereo vision method which applies two cameras. The other is the RGBD sensors such as Kinect and Primesense. It seems that both methods are in use currently. However, I do not know what are their advantages against each other.
I think the Kinect is a perfect solution over stereo vision ignoring its expense. So I have two questions here:

Is there advantages of binocular methods over Kinect besides expense?
As I know, both the two methods are confined with a limited distance detection range. In real world applications, we sometimes also need depth data at distance. Is there a method that we can acquire or estimate data information at far distance( not considering  laser-based detectors ).

Further more, my application may be a small flight vehicle. Which method and equipment should I choose? Will the traditional binocular camera be too slow for my application?

6767,Magnetometer to measure high angular velocity in small object,"I have to measure the frequency of a little circle in rotation. You can image this circle flying in air, because this circle can't touch anything that is not in rotation. So I can't use some simple trick to count the number of complete rotation in an amount of time.
So I supposed my only chance was to use an accelerometer, a gyroscope, or a magnetometer. The accelerometer can detect the centripetal acceleration, and the gyroscope and the magnetometer with some calculus directly the frequency.
The problem is the high frequency of this circle (can reach up to 50 Hz). Doing some simple calculus we know we need a gyroscope that can measure big angular velocity: 50*360/s = 18.000/s. Also the accelerometer need big range of values (the radius of the circle is only 5 cm): w (angular velocity) = (2 * 3,14) / (1/50) = 314 rad/sec acc_centr = w^2 * R = 98596 * 0,05 ~ 5000m/s^2 ~ 500g
Now I have seen there are some accelerometer or gyroscope for industrial purposes with enough range, but my question is:
How I can understand if a magnetometer can used is this kind of application? Considering there is no magnetic field near the circle, can a magnetometer be used to measure quickly change in inclination? In the datasheet i can read how ofter the sensor can communicate with my arduino, but nothing about how quick the rotation can be.
Is the reason that a magnetometer don't have the limits of a gyroscope or an accelerometer?

However the Scout is a different beast entirely. It's a purpose built kit with 12 servos and to control them I'm using the LYNX SSC-32 Sequencer which is distributed freely on their website.

I know that the accel-data provide long term stability, but are useless for short term and the gyroscope is more or less vice versa. 
So there are tons of strategies to ""marry"" this values, but how does the magnetic field measurement fit into this framework?
Basically the magnetic field measurement should provide an attitude, too. Like the other two sensors combined. I guess this measurement alone is neither reliable.

6810,Particle Filter Sampling Step,"I emphasize that my question is about sampling, not resampling.  
I'm reading the Probabilistic Robotics book by Thrun et al, Chapter 4 on Non-Parametric Filters.  The section on Particle filters has an algorithm which states that for each particle index $m$ (see line 4):  
sample $x_t^{[m]} \sim p(x_t|u_t,x_{t-1}^{[m]})$
The text's explanation of this step is quoted as:

Line 4. generates a hypothetical state $x_t^{[m]}$ for time t based on
  the particle $x_{t-1}$ and the control $u_t$.  The resulting sample is
  index by $m$, indicating that it is generated from the $m$-th particle
  in $\chi_{t-1}$.  This step involves sampling from the state
  transition distribution $p(x_t|u_t,x_{t-1})$.  To implement this step,
  one needs to be able to sample from this distribution.  The set of
  particles obtained after $M$ iterations is the filter's representation
  of $\bar{bel}(x_t)$.

If I understand correctly, this step says that the m-th sampled particle $x_t^{[m]}$ is obtained by advancing the previous m-th particle with control command $u_t$.  I assume that the motion is not deterministic, so the result of this motion is a conditional probability, based on the particle's previous position $u_t$.  
However, I'm confused over how exactly to construct this conditional probability $p(x_t|u_t,x_{t-1}^{[m]})$.  Is this information usually given?  Or is it constructed from the distribution of the other particles?

6821,Is motor current proportional to thrust?,"So I was making sure my circuit for an airboat I was working on was safe. And checking a motor, it has 35 amps max current running 11.1v at 1000. (However my ESC has a 30 current, 40 burst amps). 
The recommended tested prop for this is a 11x9 3-blade and runs the motor at 20 amps. Doing some quick calculations via on online calculator, it appears to give a value of 5.4lbs of force (way off to the 2.65 lbs measured, but regardless...). When I type in a prop I want (13x6) it gives a thrust value of 7.53 .
Now, if the motor current is proportional to the thrust, 5.4 lbs / 20 amps = 7.53 / running amps. And therefore the amount of amps the prop would be, in theory a little less than 30 if this is indeed the case. Thus safe for my application. 
This would also make sense in physics terms as Power = Current*Voltage which is proportional to thrust, but just need to make sure.
So does this thought process work for choosing a prop? My device will  be doing very short runs (less than 25 seconds), so near-boundaries should be safe...

6822,What is the link between a quadcopter transmitter pulse and the roll/pitch/yaw angles?,"I want to design a data logger for my quadcopter using the Arduino Mega board. I want to record the roll, pitch and yaw angles each second or 5 seconds, so they can be viewed later after a flight has ended. There's just one thing I don't understand, and that's how to translate the pitch/roll/yaw angles into a pulse of a specific length that the flight controller receives.
For example, when I press the control for the pitch, the transmitter sends out a pulse to the receiver of the drone and the speed of the drones' motors change accordingly for it to pitch either forward or backward. I can tap into these commands between the flight controller and the transmitter, and be able to record the length of the pulse that was sent out. However, what is the link between the pitch angle and the size of the pulse? Basically, how can I convert the pulse that was recorded by the Arduino board and convert it into the pitch angle in degrees? 
Generally, for the transmitter I use, a 1500us-pulse means zero pitch; from 1501-2000 means pitch forward, and from 1000-1499 means pitch backwards (of course, the actual values vary slightly, but this is just a general reference for this question). So for instance, if I sent a pulse of 1400us, how would that translate into an angle in degrees? What's the formula to convert it?
I hope I'm clear, and if this question sounds stupid, please excuse me, but I haven't been able to find good information on it!

It also only has two hardware PWM pins and I'm unsure whether software PWM would be enough. I found the Afro SimonK-based ESCs from HobbyKing which have I2C (Intended for the MikroKopter).
I've looked around and people have used the Adafruit 16-channel PWM/Servo drivers to control them. Is this an option to look into? Or is there perhaps a better way?
Also, would be it particularly safe if the RPi is run off the ESC's BEC? It's confusing because, when the ESC is powered on, well, it'll be powered on before the RPi comes up. What do ESCs do when they have bad input?

6838,Implementation of wall and obstacle avoidance,"I have a task of developing a simulation of an adaptive robot control system but I don't seem too have anyone to discuss my uncertainties with. I want to keep the simulation as simple as possible as I have a very tight deadline and it's only a one off project that most probably will never be used in my life again. 
The minimal behaviour that the agent is supposed to exhibit is wall and obstacle avoidance. It can be extended to avoiding small objects and exploring large ones. 
I've decided to go with a simple feedback control system. 
To begin with I'm struggling to decide how to represent the map of agent's environment. What I mean is, what if I want a wall to be from coordinate [0,0] to [0.5]. I could hard code it, e.g. have a matrix with coordinates of all obstacles but how small units do I make... I.e. what if I have two neighbouring coordinates [0,0.01] and [0,0.02] but the agents gets a 'clear to go' to coordinate [0,0.05]. In this case it doesn't know that it actually is about to walk into a wall. I've heard of something called occupancy grid map but I don't exactly get how it works and how to implement it. 
Another thing that I am struggling with is how do I distinct between a wall and an obstacle? And then, how do I let the agent know how big that obstacle is so that it can either avoid it or explore it. 
Eh, I'm really puzzled with this project.
I would really appreciate any thoughts or directions. Thank you. :-)

6849,Graph optimization with G2O,"I'm trying to do graph optimization with G2O, mainly in order to perform loop closure. However finding minimal working examples online is an issue (I've found this project, as well as this one. The second one though has the form of a library, so one cannot really see how the author uses things.)
In contrast to online loop closure, where people update and optimize a graph every time they detect a loop, I'm doing graph optimization only once, after pairwise incremental registration. So in my case, pairwise registration and global, graph-based optimization are two separate stages, where the result of the first is the input for the second.
I already have a working solution, but the way that works for me is quite different from the usual use of g2o:

As nodes I have identity matrices (i.e. I consider that my pointclouds are already transformed with the poses of the pairwise reg. step) and 
as edges, I use the relative transformation based on the keypoints of
the pointclouds (also the keypoints are transformed). So in this case
I penalize deviations of the relative pose from the identity matrix.
As Information matrix (inverse of covariance) I simply use a 6x6
identity matrix multiplied by the number of found correspondences
(like this case). 
The result of the graph is an update matrix,
i.e. I have to multiply with this the camera poses. 

Although this works in many/most cases, it is a quite unusual approach, while one cannot draw the graph for debugging (all nodes are identities in the beginning, and the result after optimization is a 3d path), which means that if something goes wrong getting an intuition about this is not always easy.
  
So I'm trying to follow the classic approach:

The vertices/nodes are the poses of the pairwise registration
The edges are the relative transformations based on the keypoints/features of the raw pointclouds (i.e. in the camera frame, not transformed by the poses of the pairwise registration)
The output are the new poses, i.e. one simply replaces the old poses with the new ones
Drawing the graph in this case makes sense. For example in case of scanning an object with a turntable, the camera poses form a circle in 3d space.
I'm trying to form all the edges and then optimize only at one stage (this doesn't mean only 1 LM iteration though).

However I cannot make things running nicely with the 2nd approach.
I've experimented a lot with the direction of the edges and the relative transformation that is used as measurement in the edges, everything looks as expected, but still no luck. For simplicity I still use the information matrix as mentioned above, it is a 6x6 identity matrix multiplied with the number of correspondences. In theory the information matrix is the inverse of covariance, but I don't really do this for simplicity (plus, following this way to compute the covariance is not very easy).
  
Are there any minimal working examples that I'm not aware of?
Is there something fundamentally wrong in what I describe above?
Are any rules of thumb (e.g. the first node in both approaches above is fixed) that I should follow and I might not be aware of them?
Update: More specific questions

The nodes hold the poses of the robot/camera. It is unclear though at which reference frame they are defined. If it is the world coordinate frame, is it defined according to the camera or according to the object, i.e. first acquired pointcloud? This would affect the accumulation of the pose matrices during incremental registration (before the g2o stage - I try to form and optimize the graph only once at the end, for all the frames/pointclouds).
The edge (Src->Tgt) constraints hold the relative transformation from pointcloudSrc to pointcloudTgt. Is it just the transformation based on the features of the two in the local coordinate frame of pointcloudSrc? Is there and tricky point regarding the direction, or just consistency with the relative transformation is enough?
The first node is always fixed. Does the fixed node affect the direction of the edge that departs/ends_up from/at the fixed node?
Is there any other tricky point that could hinter implementation?
I'm working in millimeter instead of meter units, I'm not sure if this will affect the solvers of g2o in any way. (I wouldn't expect so, but a naive use of g2o that was giving some usable results was influenced)

I did tests with BLuetooth, but sometimes there are connectivity issues, and pairing devices can be a hassle in a classroom. I have also tried WiFi modules, but pinging it showed average time of 19ms, but maximum of more than 500ms, so I'm afraid that it won't be able to control linefollower robot for example. 
Can you point me to some other, preferably cheap (under 10$ per module) wireless technologies? Or maybe my worries about WiFi are exaggerated?

6880,Monocular vs. stereo computer vision robustness for object detection,"Are there some genaral rules for the robustness between monocular and stereo vision when considering object detection? I am especially interested in the automotive field - considering distance/obstacle/car detection (see video links below).
Someone told me monocular vision is more robust than stereo. I guess this may be true if the monocular algorithm is well written (and especially verified over lots of input data)... but once you input (image) data that has not been verified it may probably provide unexpected results, right? With stereo vision one does not really care about the contents of the image as long as texture/lighting conditions allow stereo matching and the object detection is then done within the point cloud.
I consider following usage:

Monocular
Stereo

The monocular sample video seems to have sometimes problems detecting the cars in front (the bounding boxes disappear once in a while). The stereo sample seems to be more robust - the car in front clearly is detected in all of sequnce image frames.

6890,Verifying motor selection calculations,"I'm trying to select a brushed DC motor for a project. I tried following the advice on sizing electric motors, mentioned in this question, but a few details were missing, and I'm unsure if I properly followed the procedure.
For my application, I need:

Nm = number of motors = 2
Wd = wheel diameter = 12 cm
Wp = estimated weight of platform = 5 kg
Minc = maximum incline under load = 5 degrees
Vmax = maximum velocity under load = 5 km/hr
Fpush = maximum pushing force = 1.25 kg

Step 1: Determine total applied force at worst case.

Step 2: Calculate power requirement.
Vradps = maximum velocity under load in radians/second = 23.1481481481 radian / second

6895,RGB-D SLAM - Compute Information Matrix,"currently im working on a RGB-D SLAM with a Kinect v1 Camera. In the front-end the SLAM estimates the pose with Ransac as an initial guess for the ICP. With the pose estimation i transform the pointcloud to a pointcloud-scene which represents my map.
To smooth the map im trying to implement a graph optimizing algorithm (g2o). 
Until now, there is no graph representation in my frontend, so i started to integrate that.
Im trying to build a .g2o file with the following fromat:
VERTEX_SE3 i x y z qx qy qz qw
where x, y, z is the translation and qx, qy, qz, qw ist the Rotation in respect to the initial coordinate system. And,
EDGE_SE3 observed_vertex_id observing_vertex_id x y z qx, qy, qz, qw inf_11 inf_12 .. inf_16 inf_22 .. inf_66
Translation and rotation for the edge is the pose estimate that i compute with Ransac and ICP (visual odometry). 
Now im getting stuck with the information matrix.
I read the chapter 3.4 THE INFORMATION FILTER in Thrun's Probabolistic Robotics and several threads in this forum, such as:
The relationship between point cloud maps and graph maps
and
information filter instead of kalman filter approach
From the second link, i got this here. 

The covariance update
  $$P_{+} = (I-KH)P$$
  can be expanded by the definition of K to be
$$ P_{+} = P - KHP$$
  $$ P_{+} = P - PH^T (HPH^T+R)^{-1} HP$$
Now apply the matrix inversion lemma, and we have:
$$P_{+} = P - PH^T (HPH^T+R)^{-1} HP$$
  $$ P_{+} = (P^{-1} + H^TR^{-1}H)^{-1}$$
Which implies:
  $$ P_{+}^{-1} = P^{-1} + H^TR^{-1}H$$
The term $P^{-1}$ is called the prior information,$$H^TR^{-1}H$$ 
  is the sensor information (inverse of sensor variance), and this gives us  $P^{-1}_+$, which is the posterior information. 

Could you please point this out for me. 
What data do i need to compute the information matrix?

Secondly, what format should my robot provide its heading in? Currently I just use a running offset from the origin angle (0), without wrapping it between 0 and 360. Turning right yields positive degrees, and left negative. I ask this as I assume the sensor model expects a certain format.
Thirdly, when computing the jacobians for adding new landmarks, (page 35) is Jz simply the absolute rotation of the robot (-540 degrees for example) plus the bearing the landmark was detected at?

6922,How is it possible to maintain the total thrust when controlling yaw of a quadcopter?,"I'm working on the control of a quadcopter and I'd like to understand how come controlling the yaw does not increase the overall thrust. My understanding is that the control is carried out through 2 PIDs per axis (roll, pitch and yaw). The output of the last PID is sent as a PWM signal to correct the rotor speeds of the propellers. The mixing looks something like that:
$T_{FrontLeft} = thrust + roll_{pid} + pitch_{pid} + yaw_{pid}$
$T_{FrontRight} = thrust - roll_{pid} + pitch_{pid} - yaw_{pid}$
$T_{RearLeft} = thrust + roll_{pid} - pitch_{pid} - yaw_{pid}$
$T_{RearRight} = thrust - roll_{pid} - pitch_{pid} + yaw_{pid}$
All the quadcopter controls seem to work that way from what I could gather. So the basic idea to control yaw is to add $yaw_{pid}$ to the clockwise motors and substract the same amount $yaw_{pid}$ to the counterclockwise motors to make the quadcopter turns clockwise. Which translates into a increase of speed of clockwise motors and a decrease of speed for counterclockwise motors from the same amount.
But we know that each motor produces thrust and torque according to those equations:
$T = C_T\rho n^2 D^4$
$Q = C_Q\rho n^2 D^5$
where $T$ is thrust, $Q$ is torque, $C_T$ and $C_Q$ are system dependent constants, $$ is the air density, $n$ is rotor speed, and $D$ is rotor diameter. Which means that the thrust produced by each motor is proportional to the propeller speed squared. 
So if $n$ is the speed of all propellers before correction, the thrust of the clockwise propellers after correction will be proportional to $(n+\Delta)^2$ and the thrust produced by the counterclockwise propellers to $(n-\Delta)^2$. The total thrust for these 2 propellers will be proportional to:
$(n+\Delta)^2 + (n-\Delta)^2 = 2n^2 + 2\Delta^2$
As you can see, there is an increase of $2\Delta^2$ in the overall thrust produced by those 2 propellers (and $4\Delta^2$ when we take the 4 propellers into account). Of course, in real life, when we control the yaw the quadcopter does not go up.
So what am I missing? 
(the same stands for roll and pitch control but since the quadcopter turns around the roll or pitch axis, the total thrust is no longer entirely on the vertical axis and I could imagine that the projection on the vertical axis is not increasing, but that does not work with yaw)

This way, it could keep track of the obstacles in a set of polar coordinates (distance, angle). But then I realised that this method doesn't account for collinear obstacles.
So the question is, what is the best way to detect a bunch of non-static obstacles within an area?

6956,using range-only sensors for mapping in SLAM,"SLAM noob here but trying to implement an algorithm that fuses odometry data and mapping based on wifi signal strengths for a 2D robot.
1)
After various readings of different resources,
I came across this - 
that explained what sensors are used in mapping and how they are categorized.
There are range-bearing sensors (stereo cameras,RGB-d cameras) that provide both distance and angle (range and bearing), from which is easy to locate (x,y) coordinates of landmarks ---> I can develop a map.
But in case I'm using wifi signal strengths (Received signal strengths) etc, in which case it is range-only (meaning, I can only establish from a robot pose(x,y,theta) as to how far this signal is coming from), how am I developing a map at all?
My question is similar to this - What algorithm can I use for constructing a map of an explored area using a number of ultrasound sensors? but not quite same.
Even if I were using IMU/GPS, how am I using GPS to develop a map? What is my state space there? If I am getting GPS signals / wifi signals/ radio signals, am I estimating the transmitter/AP's location as the map? or the walls of a room I'm navigating in, as a map?
A lot of SLAM literature talks about motion model and measurement model, the former gives me the pose of the robot quite easily because of the odometry and imu. 
The latter though is more for development of a map. Am I right in understanding this? If yes, say 
a] I have walls in a room and I'm using Lidar scanner - 
this still gives me the location of the wall using the number of beams that give me bearing, and the average distance from all the beams.
b] Or if I have just a single laser scanner, I can still use a camera (distance) and the heading of the robot to calculate the location of wall (the map). 
But If I have wireless signal strengths, I have a distance (distance of the transmitter from which I'm getting the RSS, not the distance of the wall) as to where they are coming from. But how am I estimating the location of walls here?

Maybe someone could share own-self experience in this filed. If band 100-900MHz could be enough to send 10kB/s from one device to another - from 2m underwater to over a dozen cm from water surface? Maybe some IC for ultrasonic communication exist? Another ideas?

6982,EKF over-correcting?,"I've been implementing an extended kalman filter, following Thrun's Probabilistic Robotics implementation. I believe my correct step may be wrong, as the state appears to be corrected far too much.
Here's a screen capture showing the issue  
Note, the bottom status reading is the 'corrected' pose coordinates.
This is my correct step:

h = The range and bearing of state landmark.
q = (landmark.x - self.X[0])^2 + (landmark.y - self.X[1])^2
My sensor covariance errors are 1cm per meter, and pi/180 for the bearing. My assumption was that the correction should be relative to the size of the robot's pose error. Which is very small in this example, as it only moved forward less than 30cm.
Is the kalman gain applied correctly here, and if yes, what other factors would result in this 'over-correcting'?
Thanks.

Then, I tried this tutorial. However, I cannot find the connman directory on my BeagleBone Black device. I looked up and assumed I needed to install the connman package, but my BeagleBone Black has no internet access.
I have also tried lsusb -v, as suggested by an answer of a similar question to this, with no luck. The weird thing is, while lsusb itself prints

  Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

lsusb -v only prints

Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

then hangs. Information regarding bus 002, which I believe the device is connected to, is not printed. I have to restart the ssh connection to get back to work. 
How should I approach to get the dongle to work on my BeagleBone Black? If the connman package is sufficient, how do I install it on my BeagleBone Black without internet access. Why does lsusb -v hang?

I'm not acquainted with how the ode45 works but lately I started reading about Euler's method in this book Numerical Methods for Engineers. If the step size is very small, then the results are satisfactory. For simulation, one can actually set the step size to be very small value. I've used ode45 in here for regulation and tracking problems. I faced some difficulties for using ode45 for tracking problem since the step size is not fixed. Now for the same experiment, I've used the Euler's method with step size 0.001 sec. The results are amazing and so friendly in comparison with ode45. This is a snapshot from the result

7008,How to decide between LiPo or LiFePo for robot battery,"When choosing a battery for a robot, should you use a LiPo or LiFePo?
For LiFePo, the pros:

can deliver higher sustained amps
many are built to be drop-in replacements for lead-acid batteries and can use the same charger

The cons:

enormously expensive (about $1/watt*hour/kg)
lower energy density than LiPo (around 110 watt*hour/kg)

For LiPo batteries, the pros:

cheaper (about $0.2/watt*hour/kg)
over twice the energy density than LiFePo (around 250 watt*hour/kg)

The cons:

more complicated and unsafe to charge (see videos of LiPos catching on fire)
most can't safely deliver high amps

Is there anything I'm missing? I see LiFePo batteries used on a lot of larger platforms, probably due to the higher continuous amp rating. I see Ebay flooded with tons of cheap high-capacity Chinese LiPos, but almost none of them have documentation, which probably means they're junk.
When should I use LiFePo vs LiPo?

For each frame in the groundthruth, i have a projection matrix.
For example:

Here the instructions provided by the readme:

Row i represents the i'th pose of the
  left camera coordinate system (i.e., z
  pointing forwards) via a 3x4
  transformation matrix. The matrices
  are stored in row aligned order (the
  first entries correspond to the first
  row), and take a point in the i'th
  coordinate system and project it into
  the first (=0th) coordinate system.
  Hence, the translational part (3x1
  vector of column 4) corresponds to the
  pose of the left camera coordinate
  system in the i'th frame with respect
  to the first (=0th) frame

But I don't know how to produce the same kind of data for me.
What I have for each frame in my case:

The Tf transformation from the init_camera (the fix one from the (0,0,0)) to the left camera which is moving. So I have the translation vector and the quaternion rotation.
The odometry data: the pose and the twist
Camera calibration parameters

With those data, How I compare with the groundtruth ? So I need to find the projection matrix from the data above but don't know how to do it.

For position tracking, usually the small angle assumption is assumed. This assumption allows for acquiring $\theta_{d}$ and $\phi_{d}$. These are the results 

The x-axis position is driving me crazy. After alot of attempts for tuning the PIDs, I felt something wrong is going on. Is this a normal behavior for PID controller? Also, what I've noticed is that once $\psi$ reaches to zero, the platform starts oscillating (after 1.5 second in the figure).   
For solving ODEs and computing the derivatives for the velocities, I use Euler methods.

Intel RealSense: 

$100

Too much expensive (not even worth mentioning)


Note: All prices are in date of April 18th 2015 and might change overtime.
As you can see, some have really goods pros, but none seems to be perfect for the task. In fact, the ZED seems to have the best specifications overall, but lacks of minimum range (since it is a large baselined camera designed for long range applications). Also, the DUO Mini LX seems to be the best for my situation, but unlike the ZED which generates really accurate depth maps, this one seems to lack of precision (lower resolution). It might be good for proximity detection, but not for 3D scanning (in my opinion). I could also try to build my own experimental stereo camera with two simple webcams, but I don't know where to start and I don't think I will have enough time to deal with all the problems I would face doing so. I am now stuck in a great dilemma.
Here are my questions:

What good resources on the internet give you a good introduction on 3D scanning concepts (theoretically and programmatically)? I will be using C++ and OpenCV (I already worked with both a lot) and/or the API provided with the chosen camera (if applies).
Should you have a static camera capturing a moving object or a moving camera capturing a static object?
Should I use something in conjunction with stereo camera (like lasers)?
Is it profitable to use more than two cameras/sensors?
Are resolution, FPS and global shuttering really important in 3D scanning?
What camera should I get (it can also be something I didn't mention, in the range of $500 maximum if possible)? My main criteria is a camera that would be able to generate an accurate depth map from close range points.

Thanks for your help!

UPDATE
I tried to write some custom code in AccelStepper.cpp's method void AccelStepper::computeNewSpeed() 
My idea was to set the speed manually during acceleration/deceleration if the speed is below my intended value. At first I thought it couldn't be a big deal, but now I see that my cpp skills seems to be not good enough or I don't understand the library quite well. 
I tried
void AccelStepper::computeNewSpeed()
{
    long distanceTo = distanceToGo(); // +ve is clockwise from curent location
    long stepsToStop = (long)((_speed * _speed) / (2.0 * _acceleration)); // Equation 16

  (The firmware version is somewhere in here, but I have no clue what to look for--let me know if you see it!) 


I mark the robot so that I will know what the true angle change has been.
I then send the following codes [128 131 145 0x00 0x0B 0xFF 0xF5 142 6]. This code starts the robot spinning slowly in a circle and request the sensor data from the sensors in the group with Packet ID 2. The output from the Create seen in RealTerm is 0x000000000000, which makes sense.
I wait until the robot has rotated a known 360 degrees, then I send [142 2] to request the angle difference. The output is now 0x00000000005B.

The OI specs say that the angle measurement is in degrees turned since the last time the angle was sent; converting 0x5B to decimal is 91, which is certainly not 360 as expected. 
What am I doing wrong here? Is the iRobot Create 2 angle measurement that atrocious, or is there some scaling factor that I am unaware of? are there any better ways to get an angle measurement?

I've been working on integrating the acceleration data from the accelorometer to get the velocity then get the position, I know that this method is not really accurate as the integration error cumulate very fast but I rely on that my calculations will be done in a very short time (about 3 seconds) then i re-calculate again from the beginning after every kick so that error doesn't cumulate hardly, Also i only need an acceptable accuracy not a very high one. I discovered then that i'm dealing with projectile motion(ball kicking), so after considering this & searching in projectile motion equations i found that i must know the initial velocity and the angle of projection(theta) to be able to get my requirements. my problem that I don't know how to get any of these , I tried different approaches like getting the horizontal distance & getting the height to get their resultant(using pythagoras) then get the angle(assuming it's a right angle) in a very small time at the beggining of the projection , but i still couldn't get the height. The gyroscope outputs roll, pitch & yaw angles related to the sensor orientation but i'm still not using this as i'm assuming that the sensor will be fixed inside the ball so it's orientation will not be the same as the projection angle.Now What I really want is any approach/idea on how to get velocity & flightPath of a projectile using accelorometer and gyroscope data.

The unit which is being used is a Flir PTU D48E
---> More about the system 
The input to the system is pixel displacement of an object to the center of the frame. The controller I am using now converts pixel distances to angular distances multiplied by a gain $K_p$. This works fine. However, I can't seem to prove why that it works so well, I mean, I know servo motors cannot be modeled like that.
The controller is fed with angular displacement and its position now => added together give me angular position I have to go to. 
The angular displacement is used as the speed it has to move with, since a huge displacement gives a huge velocity.
By updating both elements at different frequency I'm able to step down the velocity such that the overshoot gets minimized. 
The problem here is: if I have to prove that the transfer function I found fits the system, I have to do tests somehow using the  function in Matlab, and I'm quite unsure how to do that. I'm also a bit unsure whether the PTU already has a controller within it, since it moves so well, I mean, it's just simple math, so it makes no sense that I'll convert it like that.

Optical Tracker Base -> Fiducial

The transform I need is:

Fiducial -> End Effector


I'm moving the arm to a series of 36 points on a path (blue line), and near each point I'm taking a position (xyz) and orientation (angle axis with theta magnitude) of Camera->Fiducial and Base->EndEffector, and putting them in the vectors required by the HandEyeCalibration Algorithm. I also make sure to vary the orientation by about +-30 degrees or so in roll pitch yaw.
I then run estimateHandEyeScrew, and I get the following results, and as you can see the position is off by an order of magnitude. 
[-0.0583, 0.0387, -0.0373] Real
[-0.185, -0.404, -0.59] Estimated with HandEyeCalib

However, I am not sure if I can compute joint angles using only the link linear and rotational acceleration?

7194,Beginner question about software for calculations,"I'm a complete beginner in robotics with background in programming...
I started thinking about a robot project yesterday and want to order some motors to test with. I saw the specs for the motors, torque etc, and I think I remember enough physics from high school to do simple calculations. For example, if the motor rotates an arm, then given the torque and the length of the arm, how much could it lift? Also, if it doesn't lift it straight up, but at an angle, I could with a bit of thinking tweak the calculations a bit... If there would be several joints attached to each other, the calculations would be more complex, but I could then probably create a program in node.js, for example, to be able to experiment with different values.
However, I would assume that these kinds of calculations would be very common when designing robots. So I would assume there are already programs for these types of calculations created. I don't know exactly what I mean with ""these types of calculations"", because I don't know yet what I don't know, so would like to ask which programs are there that you guys use for making calculations when you design your robots?

As my son is getting ready for bed, he needs someone to talk him through his steps, give him positive feedback, and ask questions like ""Okay, you're in your pajamas.  Great!

7215,Arduino-Create 2: Reading Sensor Values,"Over the past few weeks, I have been attempting to interface the iRobot Create 2 with an Arduino Uno. As of yet, I have been unable to read sensor values back to the Arduino. I will describe by hardware setup and my Arduino code, then ask several questions; hopefully, answers to these questions will be helpful for future work with the Create 2.
Hardware:
The iRobot Create 2 is connected to the Arduino Uno according to the suggestions given by iRobot. Instead of the diodes, a DC buck converter is used, and the transistor is not used because a software serial port is used instead of the UART port.
Software:
The following is the code that I am implementing on the Arduino. The overall function is to stop spinning the robot once the angle of the robot exceeds some threshold. A software serial port is used, which runs at the default Create 2 Baud rate.

Questions:

Am I loading the sensor values into the array correctly? This same code works when a bump and run program is implemented, but that requires knowing only one bit rather than two bytes.
How many bytes can be read over the serial connection at a time? A previous post (Help sending serial command to Roomba) highlights that one byte can be sent at a time. Does this imply that the reverse is true? If so, would a solution be to use a char array to read the values instead and then to append two chars to form an signed int?
Is serial communication synchronization a problem? I am assuming that synchronization is not a problem, but is it possible for the bytes to be split on the nibble boundaries? This would present a problem because there is not a nibble datatype.

7219,Issue with multiple bytes from Irobot Create 2,"I was having problems reading sensor information from my Irobot Create 2 and sent an email asking for help from the Irobot staff. They were super helpful and gave me an answer(the next day!!!) that helped push along my project. I was requesting data from the create2 to print to the screen so I could figure out how to write a code that would read the data. I started with this section of code that was not working for me (I trimmed some of the code off that controlled other functions):

They told me that the code was actually working fine but I was trying to print out the value of the sensor packet without parsing it in any way. They then recommended I change the code in program2 to this:
while True:

    def toHexFromByte(val):
        return hex(ord(val))[2:}.rjust(2, '0').upper()

    x = connection.read()
    for b in x:
        print toHexFromByte(b)

this works beautifully and prints to the screen if the bumper is pressed or a wheel drops. My question is how to deal with responses that are longer than one byte (ie Packet ID: 22 for voltage)? 
When I try Packet ID: 22 it prints to screen and it sends the high byte of 3F and a low byte of D7. I can manually combine them to get 3FD7 and convert it to a decimal of 16.343 Volts but I would like to figure a way to print to screen the the voltage by having my program do this for me. Many of the sensors send data in 2 bytes and I need a way to make sure that it is combined automatically.

The code above prints out the encoder counts; however, when the wheels are spun backwards, the count increases and will never decrement.

7234,Are LiPo really 100 times more energy dense than model rockets?,"Lately I've been interested in comparing the energy density of model rocket engines to lithium polymer batteries (attached to motors and propellers) for propelling things upwards.
To get a feel for this, I decided to compare an Estes C6-5 motor to a 3DR Iris + quadcopter.
Estes C6-5 has initial mass of 25.8g, and produces 10 N s total impulse. So, the ""Impulse density"" is about 10 N s / 25.8g = 0.38 N s g^-1.
3DR Iris+ weighs 1282g without battery. 3.5ah battery weighs 250g and will power hover for about 20 minutes (so about 10.5a draw). Thrust produced to hover on Earth is 9.8N kg^-1 * 1.532 kg = 14.7N. ""Impulse density"" is 14.7N * 1200s / 250g = 70.6 N s g^-1 .
So, according to my math here, the LiPo is about 0.38/70.6 = 186 times more energy dense than the model rocket engine.
Of course, the model rocket engine will lose 12.48g of propellant by the end of the flight so it will be effectively a little lighter, but that's not going to affect things by a factor of 100.
Does this seem right to you? Am I missing anything?

7235,how to implement and code inner and outer PD controllers for quadrotor for position tracking,"The quadrotor system is  multi-ODEs equations. The linearized model is usually used especially for position tracking, therefore one can determine the desired x-y positions based on the roll and pitch angles. As a result,  one nested loop which has inner and outer controllers is needed for controlling the quadrotor. For implementation, do I have to put  inside ode45 for the inner attitude controller? I'm asking this because I've read in a paper that the inner attitude controller must run faster (i.e. 1kHz) than the position controller (i.e. 100-200 Hz). In my code, both loops run at 1kHz, therefore inside ode45 there is no while-loop. Is this correct for position tracking? If not, do I have to insert while-loop inside ode45 for running the inner loop? Could you please suggest me a pseudocode for position tracking?
To be more thorough, the dynamics equations of the nonlinear model of the quadrotor is provided  here, if we assume the small angles, the model is reduced to the following equations 
$$
\begin{align}
\ddot{x}      &= \frac{U_{1}}{m} ( \theta \cos\psi + \phi \sin\psi) \\
\ddot{y}      &= \frac{U_{1}}{m} ( \theta \sin\psi - \phi \cos\psi) \\
\ddot{z}      &= \frac{U_{1}}{m} - g   \\
\ddot{\phi}   &= \frac{l}{I_{x}} U_{2} \\
\ddot{\theta} &= \frac{l}{I_{y}} U_{3} \\
\ddot{\psi}   &= \frac{1}{I_{z}} U_{4} \\
\end{align}
$$
The aforementioned equations are linear. For position tracking, we need to control $x,y,$ and $z$, therefore we choose the desired roll and pitch (i.e. $\phi^{d} \ \text{and} \ \theta^{d}$)
$$
\begin{align}
\ddot{x}^{d} &= \frac{U_{1}}{m} ( \theta^{d} \cos\psi + \phi^{d} \sin\psi) \\
\ddot{y}^{d} &= \frac{U_{1}}{m} ( \theta^{d} \sin\psi - \phi^{d} \cos\psi) \\
\end{align}
$$
Therefore, the closed form for the desired angles can be obtained as follows
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\phi_{d} \\
\theta_{d} 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\sin\psi & \cos\psi \\
-\cos\psi & \sin\psi 
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
\left( \frac{m}{U_{1}}\right) 
\begin{bmatrix}
\ddot{x}^{d} \\
\ddot{y}^{d}
\end{bmatrix}

7244,Conceptual problem regarding electronic shutters,"I have been looking at CCD and CMOS sensors and cameras to decide which one to use in the process of automatic control of a printing process. By now I am getting the grips on almost all the essential numbers and abbreviations but there remains a problem with shutters.
I understand that there are different types of shutters, both mechanical and electronic, and I can understand how they work. My problem concerns shutter speed. If I use a mechanical shutter, well then the maximum shutter speed depends on that particular element in the assembly, but how does it work for electronic shutters? I have never read ""Max shutter speed"" in any specs. The only thing I usually see floating around are frames per second. But those do usally not pass a limit of about 120 fps. Depending on how the sensor it is built one could think that the maximum shutter speed therefore is 1/120 or 1/240 if it uses half frames.
Can this be right? It seems really slow. I will be faced with the task of recording crisp and clear images of paper which moves at about 17 m/s. That is never possible with shutter speeds that slow. Will I be forced to use a mechanical shutter or am I misunderstanding something?

7266,How can I make a quadcopter avoid obstacles using infrared?,"I have a quadcopter built, and I need to be able to make it to autonomously follow a route and avoid obstacles where possible.
My general plan is to have an array of sensors on a pre-defined ""front"". The quadcopter will only go forward. Generally I'd like to make  it so that if the sensors pointing at a higher angle detect something getting closer as the bot moves forward, the quadcopter will stop, descend until the distance to that detected object decreases, and then continues forward. Similarly, I'd like the opposite event to happen if the sensors pointing at a lower angle detect something getting closer to the quadcopter.
I'm thinking of having something like 9 small infrared distance detectors (pointing up, forward, down || left, forward, right), basically a 3x3 matrix.
Would anyone have any ideas of the feasibility of this? I'd like to use a raspberry pi, but it will probably also need an additional board to read in the values from its sensors. In addition, I have no idea which sensors to use, or if infrared can even work. Any suggestions are more than welcome.
I was also thinking about ultrasonic sensors, but having 9 of them could get cluttered, and I'd worry about their short range when a crash means death for the quadcopter. I also fear they would cause interference with each other.

I've read Roy Featherstone's Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms cover-to-cover, and I've also read the Dynamics section from the Springer Handbook of Robotics (also written by Featherstone). 
It took me a long time to get acclimated to using his ""spatial vector"" and ""spatial matrix"" notation, but after re-creating all of his notation by hand as an exercise it works out to just be a nice way of concatenating 3x3 and 3x1 matrices and vectors into 6x6 and 6x1 matrices and vectors. The maths he invents to perform operations can be a bit tedious to read as he hijacks some standard notation, but overall everything is very compact, very easy to implement in MATLAB. 
My problem is this: How do I add actuators to the model? He walks through explicitly configuring the joint definitions, link definitions, etc., but when it comes to actuators or applied forces he says something like, ""Just add a $\tau_a$ here and Bob's your uncle!"" - it's not discussed at all. In the Handbook of Robotics he suggests introducing a false acceleration to the fixed base to add the gravitational force term, but doesn't show how to add it in local coordinates nor does he mention how to add the actuator input. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. I've considered starting over with a different book, but it's going to be a great expense of my time to re-acclimate myself to a different set of notation. I'd like to move forward with this, but I feel like I'm just a few inches shy of the finish line.

7288,Linear Motion Control for quadrotor (clarification),"I've posted a question regarding this matter that I couldn't solve. I'm reading this paper, the authors state 

Linear $x$ and $y$ Motion Control: From the mathematical model one can see
  that the motion through the axes $x$ and $y$ depends on $U_{1}$. In fact $U_{1}$ is
  the total thrust vector oriented to obtain the desired linear motion.
  If we consider $U_{x}$ and $U_{y}$ the orientations of $U_{1}$ responsible for the
  motion through x and y axis respectively, we can then extract from
  formula (18) the roll and pitch angles necessary to compute the
  controls $U_{x}$ and $U_{y}$ ensuring the Lyapunov function to be negative
  semi-definite ( see Fig. 2).

The paper is very clear except in the linear motion control. They didn't explicitly state the equations for extracting the angles. The confusing part is when they say 

we can then extract from
  formula (18) the roll and pitch angles necessary to compute the
  controls $U_{x}$ and $U_{y}$

where formula (18) is
$$
U_{x} = \frac{m}{U_{1}} (\cos\phi \sin\theta \cos\psi + \sin\phi \sin\psi) \\
U_{y} = \frac{m}{U_{1}} (\cos\phi \sin\theta \sin\psi - \cos\phi \cos\psi) \\
$$
It seems to me that the roll and pitch angles depend on $U_{x}$ and $U_{y}$, therefore we compute the roll and pitch angles based on the $U_{x}$ and $U_{y}$ to control the linear motion.

7294,Dispensing precise quantities of liquid and powder,"I've been toying around with the idea of automating the process of testing aquarium water for certain chemicals. Very briefly, salt water aquariums (reefs, specifically) require almost-daily testing for 3-4 chemicals (calcium, alkalinity, ammonia, phosphate). This is typically done by hand, using various kits. There are two main types 

you combine several powders with a fixed amount of aquarium water, and then compare the color the mixture turns with a chart
you combine several liquids together with the aquarium water, and then add another liquid until the mixture turns a color. you then record how much of the final liquid you had to add for the color change to occur (titration).

Both methods are straightforward, but tedious. To maintain an aquarium well, you really do need daily readings of all of those metrics, which easily adds up to 30 minutes+ daily.
So - I'd like to be able to automate the process. The biggest question is, how do I reliably dispense the materials needed? We're talking in gram and milliliter UoM here. The kits come with plastic syringes and spoons of correct volume for the powders. I need a way to measure out and dispense both of these, and a way to queue up several days worth (refilling daily defeats the purpose).
Any ideas?
Edit this is different from How to measure and dispense a finite amount of powder or liquid because of the units of measure involved. I need to be able to reliably dispense ~ 1g +/- 5% of a powder, or 1ml +/- 5% of liquid.

I've switched to linear model, hope I can do it. For regulation problem, the position control seems working but once I switch to tracking, the system starts oscillating. I don't know why. I have stated what I've done below hope someone guides me to the correct path. 
The linear model of the quadrotor is provided here which is 
$$
\begin{align}
\ddot{x}    &= g \theta \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)\\
\ddot{y}    &= - g \phi \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (2)\\

\ddot{\theta} &= \frac{L}{J_{y}} U_{2} \\
\ddot{\psi} &= \frac{1}{J_{z}} U_{2} \\
\end{align}
$$
In this paper, the position control based on PD is provided. In the aforementioned paper, from (1) and (2) the desired angles $\phi^{d}$ and $\theta^{d}$ are obtained, therefore, 
$$
\begin{align}
\theta^{d}  &= \frac{\ddot{x}^{d}}{g}  \\
\phi^{d}    &= - \frac{\ddot{y}^{d}}{g}
\end{align}
$$
where 
$$
\begin{align}
\ddot{x}^{d} &= Kp(x^{d} - x) + Kd( \dot{x}^{d} - \dot{x} ) \\
\ddot{y}^{d} &= Kp(y^{d} - y) + Kd( \dot{y}^{d} - \dot{y} ) \\
U_{1} &= Kp(z^{d} - z) + Kd( \dot{z}^{d} - \dot{z} ) \\
U_{2} &= Kp(\phi^{d} - \phi) + Kd( \dot{\phi}^{d} - \dot{\phi} ) \\
U_{3} &= Kp(\theta^{d} - \theta) + Kd( \dot{\theta}^{d} - \dot{\theta} ) \\
U_{4} &= Kp(\psi^{d} - \psi) + Kd( \dot{\psi}^{d} - \dot{\psi} ) \\
\end{align}
$$
with regulation problem where $x^{d} = 2.5 m, \ y^{d} = 3.5 m$ and $z^{d} = 4.5 m$, the results are 


Now if I change the problem to the tracking one, the results are messed up. 


In the last paper, they state 

A saturation function is needed to ensure that the reference roll and
  pitch angles are within specified limits


Unfortunately, the max value for $\phi$ and $\theta$ are not stated in the paper but since they use Euler angles, I believe $\phi$ in this range $(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$ and $\theta$ in this range $[-\pi, \pi]$
I'm using Euler method as an ODE solver because the step size is fixed. For the derivative, Euler method is used.

7333,Why do my ESCs stop working?,"I'm new to robotics and this is my first time building a quadcopter.  I'm unable to work out why I keep losing ESCs.
Most recently in testing, I've managed to calibrate all 4 ESCs and accurately control the speed of all 4 motors.  But after neatly securing them to the frame, 1 motor didn't work.  I recalibrated the ESCs again and, when running them again, the motor still didn't work.  However, the other 3 motors continued to run at first, but also suddenly just stopped altogether.
Research suggested that ESCs have a cut-off voltage, indicating that my battery might be too flat, so I immediately looked to recharging it. To my surprise, the (still very new) battery appeared to have bulged out, indicating that it had been damaged.
Further research suggested that the size of the battery I was using is insufficient for the amount of current drawn by the motors.  So, without any PWM applied, I reconnected a new fully charged battery in the hope of listening for any beeps to diagnose, and one ESC immediately coughed up a huge puff of smoke.
Before all of this happened, I only managed to get 2 of the ESCs to run their motors.  Despite several attempts at tweaking PWM signals and calibrating them, I ended up replacing the other 2.
Unless there's some obvious reason for my ESCs to keep dying on me, I can only assume that these specific ESCs are badly made and I should ask for my money back.

After a few days of looking around on the web for how to design such a system, I'm still at a loose end whether (a) it is even feasible (b) if so, what the best approach is to interface the laptop with the motors? The image processing must run on Linux, so there is no leeway to change that part of things.

In my case, I'm working with a simulation. I'm moving my robot in a corridor-like featureless environment (only two walls) and I don't get a map. Nevertheless, if I move in a sinewave motion, I'm able to get a map. Moreover, if I have an additional feature, the algorithm even shows the real path as long as this feature is seen (right part of the image), otherwise it shows a very weird-looking oscillatory path which does not resemble a sinewave at all. Something important to notice is that the width of the map is pretty accurate (real=4m, map's=4.014m), and the length of the movement is also somehow accurate (real=15m, map's= 15.47). I'm using a Hokuyo URG-04LX laser range finder, no odometry, no IMU. I'm running in Ubuntu 14.04 and using ROS Indigo.

To my dismay the communication part is not working, and I've tried hard for a day to fix it with no result. Here is the relavent code running on the pandaboard:

7415,Quadcopter PID output and duty cycle conversion,"I'm trying to design two PD controllers to control the roll and pitch angle of my quadcopter and a P controller to control the yaw rate. I give to the system the reference roll, pitch and yaw rate from a smartphone controller (with WiFi).In the case of roll and pitch the feedback for the outer 'P' loop is given by my attitude estimation algorithm, while in the inner 'D' loop there is no reference angle rate, and the feedback is provived by a filtered version of the gyroscope data.
As far the yaw rate is concerned, is only a P controller, the reference yaw rate is given by the smartphone, and the feedback of the only loop is provived by the smartphone. This is to illustrate the situation. My sampling frequency is 100hz (imposed by the attitude estimation algorithm, that is a Kalman Filter, that I'm using). I have tuned my controller gains with matlab, imposing a rise time of 0.1 seconds and a maximum percent overshoot of 2% with root locus. Matlab is able to found me a solution, but with very large gains (like 8000 for P and 100 for D). I was doing the tuning, using a quadcopter model (for each euler angle) based on the linearized model for quadcopter or instance : $$\ddot \tau_\Phi = I_x\ddot \Phi    ->  G_\Phi(s) = \frac{I_x }{ s^2} $$ only in order to have a 'reasoned' starting point for my gains, and then re-tune it in the reality. (The transfer function above is continous, in my model I have obliviously used the discrete version at 100hz of sampling rate). 
This is to do a premise of my following questions.
Now, I have to map my controller outputs to duty cycle. Since I'm using a PWM at 25Khz frequency, my period (in the TIM channel configuration) is of 2879.
I have checked the activation threshold (after which the motor starts move) and the threshold after which it stops increasing its speeds, and the first is 202
and the second is 2389.
I was following the very good answer of Quadcopter PID output but I still have some questions.
1) As far the throttle mapping is concerned, I have to map it in such a way that the values coming from my smartphone controller (in the interval [0, 100]) are not
mapped in the whole [202, 2389] interval, but I have to 'reserve' some speed in order to allow the quadcopter to have an angular movement exploiting differences in the 4 motor speeds even with 100% throttle?
2) Coming back to the fact that matlab propose me huge gains for my controllers, this leads to the fact that I cannot directly sum the controller output to the duty cycle as stated in the metioned answer (because I will certainly go out of the [202, 2389] bound of my TIM pulse). Doing a proportion will result in altering the gains of the systems, so placing somewhere else the poles of my systems and the procedure done with matlab will became useless, right? So, what I'm doing wrong? I have tried to enforce matlab to bound the gainsm for instance in the [0,100] interval, but in this case it cannot find gains such that my constraints are verified.

So, because I need some technical arguments (rather than a plain ""ros is not real time"") I will be more specific (suppose we have ROS under a RTOS):

I read that ROS uses a TCP/IP-based communication for ROS topics and I know that TCP/IP is not reliable. That means I cannot use topics in a real time loop? For instance send a control signal to my system publishing it to a topic, and the system sending me some feedback via a topic?
If I have a RTOS (eg Linux+Xenomai) can I build a real time control loop for a robot using ROS, or ROS will be a bottleneck?

Maybe the above are naive or I lack some knowledge, so please enlighten me!

So, this part of it I'm relating to is about how much damping - not how much stiffness - should we display to obtain stability, given a structural stiffness. I changed the question accordingly - what is achievable stiffness of a impedance/admittance controlled robot, given its structural and control stiffnesses? (Stiffness/compliance is, of course, mathematically just one of the terms in total impedance/admittance)
Let us consider a haptic device with mechanical and control parts, and mechanical part is not infinitely rigid (compliant). Basically, it would be a robot with impedance or admittance control. I thought perceivable stiffness can be just as simple as serial connection of two stiffnesses - and so the stiffer mechanical structure is, the better it can display control stiffness:
$k = \frac{k_e k_c}{k_e + k_c}$
where $k_c$ is stiffness control. Still, I cannot find any confirmation to this, although something very similar is stated in Samur's ""Performance Metrics for Haptic Interfaces"". I would be very grateful if you could refer me to some sources or just plain prove it wrong or right (:

My application is, I want to build a quadcopter that could hover in one place even in the presence of (reasonable) winds: the quadcopter ideally would tilt towards random gusts to maintain a certain position. Every single tutorial I could find on the Internet only uses the accelerometer to estimate where down is when stationary, and simply assumes that using the gyroscope to hold the quadcopter level is enough.

I recently saw TED talks on AI and the Google car, with these being the most interesting to me:

Hod Lipson - Building ""self-aware"" robots 
Juan Enriquez - The next species of human
Ray Kurzweil - Get ready for hybrid thinking

The third one led me to the 'criticism' section (labeled  on that wiki article, though it certainly at least partially reads as a criticism section as well) of Kurzweil 'theory' of the brain, namely ""Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind"" (PRTM).  After some link surfing on the people who have performed analysis of PRTM and their respective academic contributions, I came to learn about Cognitive Architecture:

""A cognitive architecture can refer to a theory about the structure of
  the human mind. One of the main goals of a cognitive architecture is
  to summarize the various results of cognitive psychology in a
  comprehensive computer model. However, the results need to be in a
  formalized form so far that they can be the basis of a computer
  program. By combining the individual results are so for a
  comprehensive theory of cognition and the other a commercially usable
  model arise. Successful cognitive architectures include ACT-R
  (Adaptive Control of Thought, ACT), SOAR and OpenCog.""

It appears that there are several interesting architectures, including the 3 mentioned above.  I read a bit about ACT-R, SOAR, OpenCog, DUAL, CHREST, and CLARION.  The list is not comprehensive.  It also appears that there are two main types of such architectures: Connectionism and Symbolic.
Though I have many questions, my main question is this:
What are some quantitative metrics and qualitative properties to measure and compare between the two architecture types?

Can all architectures be categorized as one, the other, or some
combination of the two, or is there a third, fourth, etc? 
How are two main types alike? How are they different?

7462,How do safety cages around quadcopter rotors/blades affect lift capabilities?,"I am interested in building a quadcopter from scratch.
Because I like to err on the side of caution, I'm considering adding ""safety cages"" around each propeller/rotor, to hopefully prevent (at least minimize) the chance of the spinning rotor blades coming into contact with someone. Without knowing much about the physics behind how ""lift"" works, I would have to imagine that cages present two main problems for rotors:

They add weight to the copter making it harder to lift the same payload; and
They're sheer presence/surface area makes it harder for the spinning rotor to generate lift and push down away from the ground

The former problem should be obvious and self-evident. For the latter problem, what I mean by ""surface area"" is that I imagine that the more caging around a spinning rotor, the more difficult it will be to lift effectively. For instance, a spinning rotor might have the ability to generate enough power to lift, say, 2kg. But if we were to construct an entire box (not cage) around the entire rotors, with 6 sides and no openings, I would imagine its lift capability would drop to 0kg.
So obviously, what I'm interested in is a cage design that provides adequate safety but doesn't ""box in"" the rotor so much that it causes the rotor to be ineffective or incapable of providing lift. So I'm looking for that optimal tradeoff of safety (boxing/caging around the spinning rotor) and lift performance.
I would imagine calculating and designing this is a pretty huge undertaking with a lot of math behind it. I'm just wondering if anyone has already figured all this stuff out, or if anyone knows of a way to model this safety-vs-lift-performance trade off in some way.

7474,How do I accurately calculate the speed of a rotary encoder at a high sample rate?,"I'm aiming to control a motorized joint at a specific speed. To do this, I'm planning on attaching a rotary encoder to do this.
I'll be controlling the motor with a PID controller. With this PID controller, I need to control the joints based on their velocity.
Since:

It would make sense to do something like this:
double getCurrentSpeed() {
    return (currentAngle - lastAngle) / samplingRate;
}

However, there's an issue; the encoder doesn't provide a high enough resolution to accurately calculate the speed (the sample rate is too high). I want to have updated data every 5-15 ms (somewhere in that range as my current motors seem to be able to respond to a change in that range)
Some more information:

14 bit precision (roughly 0.0219726562 degrees per ""step"" of encoder
I'd like to be able to calculate as small of speed differences as possible
As the motors will be going fairly fast (120+ degrees/second at highly variable speeds and directions), so the feedback has to be accurate and not delayed at all

So, a couple of ideas:

I can find encoders that I can sample at a very high rate. I was thinking about sampling the time between the changes of the encoder's value. However, this seems finicky and likely to be noise-prone

Noise filter of some sort, although I don't know if that would work given the rapidly changing values of this application

However, none of these seem ideal. Is my only option to get a 16 bit (or higher!) encoder? Or is there another method/combination of methods that I could use to get the data I need?

7486,How to determine how long a battery will power a robotic circuit for?,"Obviously robotic circuits draw different amounts of power/current. So given the same battery, say, a 9V, then connecting it to 2 different circuits will deplete it at two different rates. Robot/Circuit #1 might drain the battery in 5 minutes. Robot/Circuit #2 might drain the battery in 20 minutes.
What ratings do batteries have that allows us to figure out how long it will power a circuit for? Bonus points: does this same rating uphold for solar panels and, in deed, all power supplies (not just batteries)?

7489,Understanding how solar panels can supply power to robotic circuits,"Say I have this solar panel that outputs 6V at 330mA, or ~1.98 Watts. If I connect that to Arduino, which expects a 5V supply at (roughly) 50mA, then the Arduino as a whole requires 5V * .05A = 0.25 Watts to power it. To me, if I understand this correctly, then in perfect weather/sunlight, the solar panel will power Arduino all day long, no problem.
Now let's say we wire up 4 motors to the Arduino, each of which draw 250 Watts. Now the Arduino + 4 motors are drawing ~1.25 Watts. But since the panels are still outputting 1.98 Watts, I would think that (again, under perfect sunlight) the panel would power the Arduino and motors all day long, no problem.
Now we add 4 more motors to the Arduino circuit, for a total of 8 motors. The circuit is now drawing 1.25 Watts + 1 W = 2.25 Watts. I would expect the solar panel to no longer be capable of powering the circuit, at least properly.
My first concern here is: am I understanding these 3 scenarios correctly? If not, where is my understanding going awry?
Assuming I'm more or less on track, my next question is: can solar panels be ""daisy chained"" together to increase total power output? In the third case above, is there a way to add a second solar panel into the mix, effectively making the two panels output 1.98 Watts * 2 = 3.96 Watts, which would then make them capable of powering the Arduino and its 8 motors (yet again, assuming perfect weather/sunlight conditions)?

From the initial research I've already done, I believe I could connect each rechargeable battery (probably LiPo) to a diode, and then wire each of the 3 diodes in series.
However, being so new to robotics/electronics, I guess I wanted to bounce this off the community as a sanity check, or to see if there is a better way of achieving this. Again, what I am looking for is a way for the circuit to automagically detect that battery #1 has more power than battery #2, and so it ""decides"" to draw power from #1. The instant #1 is depleted or deemed ""less powerful"" than #2, the #2 battery takes over. Thoughts/criticisms?

7493,Discover vector/angle between stereo camera pose and vehicle body,"I have a calibrated stereo camera system that is mounted in a passenger car which means I am able to retrieve a point cloud from my stereo image. However, I need to find how well is the camera aligned with the vehicle - read: if the camera is perfectly facing forwards or not. I guess it will never perfectly face forwards so I need to get the angle (or rather 3D vector) between ""perfect forwards"" and ""actual camera pose"".
What came to my mind is to drive the vehicle possibly perfectly forwards and use stereo visual odometry to detect the angle of vehicle movement as seen by camera (which is the vector I am looking for). The LIBVISO library for visual odometry can output a 3D vector of movement change from one stereo frame to another which could be used to detect the needed vector.
The only problem may be to actually be able to drive perfectly forward with a car. Maybe an RTK GPS could be used to check for this or for correction. Will anyone have a suggestion on how to proceed?

What I want is that this spring's rate be electronically adjustable in real time, for instance a microcontroller system might increase the spring's rate when it detects a larger weight.

As the data exchange of the measurements carries some latency, the data has to be extrapolated be able to obtain the current position. Due to extrapolation an error appears in the triangulated data.
I know that when the ball is in the air, the velocity of the ball should be constant in x and y directions and the velocity in the z direction should decay with g. The velocities in x and y however oscillate as function of time around a mean value which is the actual x respectively y velocity. The same goes for when I compute the acceleration in the z direction. It oscillates as function of time around g.
Given that I know how the ball should behave, i.e. that vx and vy should be constant and that the acceleration in the z direction should be z, how can I impose these conditions to better estimate the triangulated position?

EDIT
My first try is with a trapezoid wave. Maybe there is an easy way without to much calculation power to change it a s-curbe. Then the accelartion/jerk will be alot smoother.
        I let the microcontroller calculate 3 different formulas afterwards it will calculate it using loop iteration. This way I can use one PID for the position. The parameters in the following code will fictional:

A big problem with the code above is that the amount of accelartion loops is a constant. It can not be changed except when you already know the amount of loops it will take.
I will be using two separate arduinos, they will be connected using a CAN-bus connection. Anyway, they won't communicate through it unless the load becomes too high. This will make Master/Slave impossible. Also the system has to be modular: adding another actuator to circuit won't be a problem. The actuator is speed controlled by using a PWM signal. The linear sensor will deliver a 0-10v signal which i will reduce to 0-5v by a simple voltage divider. The loop will be around 5 to 10 ms, will depend on the maximum looptime.
Arduino has a 10-bit(1023) ADC but use of oversampling I will probably try to increase it to 12-bit. To not decrease the reading speed I will decrease the prescaler of the ADC.
The PWM output is 8-bit(255), I am trying to find a way to further increase. Because I think 255 steps are too low for my application.
Because the Arduino has limit internal memory, pre calculating all the positions is impossible.

\omega^R \\
a^W \\
\alpha^R
\end{pmatrix}
$$
where:

$r^W$ :   3D coordinates of camera w.r.t world
$q^W$ :   unit quaternion describing camera pose w.r.t world
$V^W$ :   linear velocity along three coordinate frames, w.r.t world
$\omega$ :   angular velocity w.r.t body frame of camera

The feature vector set is described as 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
y_1 \\
y_2  \\
\vdots \\
y_n
\end{pmatrix}
$$
where, each feature point is described using XYZ parameters.
For the EKF acting under an unknown linear and angular acceleration $[A^W,\psi^R] $ , the process model used for predicting the next state is:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
r^W + V^W\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}\bigl(a^W + A^W\bigr)\Delta t^2 \\
q^W \bigotimes q^W\bigl(\omega^R\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}\bigl(\alpha^R + \psi^R\bigr)\Delta t^2\bigr)   \\

\omega^R + \bigl(\alpha^R + \psi^R\bigr)\Delta t \\
a^W + A^W \\
\alpha^R + \psi^R
\end{pmatrix}
$$

So far, I'm clear with the EKF steps. Post this prediction step, I'm not clear how to perform the measurement update of the system state.
From this slide, I was under the impression that we need to initialize random depth particles between 0.5m to 5m from the camera. But, at this point, both the camera pose and the feature depth is unknown.

I can understand running a particle filter for estimating feature
depth if camera pose is known. I tried to implement such a concept in this project: where I read the camera pose from a ground truth file and keep triangulating the depth of features w.r.t world reference frame
I can also comprehend running a particle filter for estimating the
camera pose if feature depths are known.

But both these parameters are unknown. How do I perform the measurement update?
I can understand narrowing down the active search region for feature matching based on the predicted next state of the camera. But after the features are matched using RANSAC (or any other algorithm), how do I find the updated camera pose? We are not estimating homography, are we?
If you have any idea regarding MonoSLAM (or RGB-D SLAM), please help me out with understanding the EKF steps.

To be more specific: is there a homography estimation step in the algorithm? how do we project the epipolar line (inverse depth OR XYZ) in the next frame if we do not have any estimate of the camera motion?

This would suggest either driving the motors at a low speed directly, or driving them at a high speed and gearing them down. As I understand it, both setups will give high torques, as brushless motors decrease torque with speed. With brushed motors, it's quite obvious that a gearbox is necessary as otherwise there is no torque in the system, but here the choice isn't as clear, which is why I am asking.

I intent to use a middleware like ROS, MIRA, YART, MOOS etc. The purpose of using one is that I want to modularise tasks, and divide the core components into subsystems, which should be run parallel(by multi-threading). But I have limited computational power (a dual core omap SoC), and the middleware, while robust should also be very efficient.
I need to use a middleware, because I don't want the program to be run on a single thread. My CPU has two cores, and it would be great if I could do some multi-threading to improve performance of the program. The middleware will provide for me the communication layer, so I don't have to worry about data races, or other problems associated with parallel processing. Also I have no prior experience writing multi-threaded programs, and so using parallel processing libraries directly would be difficult. Hence IMO, middlewares are excellent choices.
In your experience, which is the best one suited for the task. I don't really want to use ROS, because it will be having a lot of features, and I wont be using them. I am a computer science student(under graduate freshman, actually) and don't mind getting my hands dirty with one which has not that much features.

7558,Problems about Complementary Filter IMU tuning,"I'm developing a project consists of an IMU controlled by Arduino through which you can send via a radio module, the data to the PC of the three Euler angles and raw data from the sensors.
For filtering I used the code made available by SparkFun: Razor AHRS 9 dof

The code does not provide radio transmissions and is tuned for 50 Hz sampling rate, in fact its parameters are:

in this project data is read every 20ms (50Hz) and records of the sensors are set to the accelerometer odr 50hz and 25 bandwidth. with the gyroscope 50 Hz odr.
In my project I used a gyroscope different, namely that I used L3G4200D frequency odr starting at 100Hz, I set then registers with the 100Hz. My global data rate is 33Hz max, beacouse the use of a radio, i read the complete date with a frequency of 33Hz.
How can i tune the Ki and Kp of my setup? the Kp is the period, I have to consider the frequency odr that I set to register in the individual sensors or i have to set the global system sample rate limited to 33Hz by the radio transmission?

7560,Digital Controller Design for System with variable sample time,"Basically I got system with a sensor and an output. I want to apply a digital implemented feedback controller. The problem in this setup is the sensor. The specifications of the module says that the sampletime of the sensor does change in wide range, depending on the usecase; from 1.3 second to 10 second. But it stays constant until the system is disabled.
My first approach was tuning a digital PID-Controller for the longest sampletime. This works fine. Even if I change the sampletime to the shortest the system stays stable, which was expected because I'm still in ROC.
The problem now is that the system's response is pretty slow.
If I design the controller for my fastest samplingrate the results are satisfying but become instable for the slowest samplerate, which can be explained again by the ROC
I could use some kind of adaptive predefined gains which I change depending on the samplerate but I was wondering if there are  control strategies which are able to handle the sampletime changes?
EDIT: 
To give a better overview I will add some details: 
I'm talking about a heating system which heats with radiation. As a sensor I use a pyrometer module with a samplingrate of up 1kHz. The problem is, that the pyrometer is not able to produce reasonable readings whenever the radiator is turned on. (Yes there are other alternatives to the pyrometer, but they start at $50k and are too expensive). The radiator has to be pulsed to operate it. So to maintain a decent heat up time and steady-state temperature the ""duty-cycle"" has to be at a decent rate(target is 95%). The minimum ""off-time"" of the radiator is 0.2 seconds before the measured values are reasonable. So at the end my sensor got an effective sampletime of 1-10seconds (by varying the duty cycle).
The hardware is hard too change, radiator and sensor have been evaluted for months right now. Therefore I try to improve the results by ""just"" changing the control algorithm.

7565,How to determine the trajectory reference on the real robot trajectory tracking,"I know that we can use some algorithms like LQR, MPC, or even PID to make the robot follows the trajectory references. In the simulation like MATLAB, I usually specify the trajectory reference by a function. Let say, given a sequence of points generated by a path planning algorithm, then I want to do a real experiment of trajectory tracking over those sequence of points. My question is:
- How to specify the errors towards the path in real situation. My impression is the generated path by path planning algorithm is uncertain due to the error of the robot sensing. And unlike the line following robot which has a real physical line for the reference, the generated path from path planning is virtual, e.g. it does not exist in the real world. I am really confused about these matter.

7575,DH-Parameters for Forward Kinematics for Translatory Motion only,"I am fairly new to the DH-transformation and I have difficulties to understand how it works. Why are not all coordinates (X+Y+Z) incorporated into the parameters? It seems to me that at least one information is useless/goes to the trash, since there is only a, d (translatory information) and alpha, theta(rotatory information). 
Example: 
The transition between two coordinate systems with identical orientation(alpha=0, theta=0) but with different coordinates(x1!=x2, y1!=y2, z1!=z2). 
DH only makes use of a maximum of two of these information.
Please enlighten me! 
Greetings
:EDIT: 
To clarify which part of the DH-Transform I don't understand, here is an example. 
Imagine a CNC-Mill(COS1) on a stand(COS0) without any variable length(=no motion) between COS0-COS1. For some reason I need to incorporate the transformation from COS0-COS1(=T0-1) into the forward transformation of my CNC-Mill. 

DH-Parameters for T0-1 would be a=5mm, alpha=90, d=2mm and theta=90. Assuming this is correct, the dX=10mm information is lost during this process?
If I recreate the relation between COS0 and COS1 according to the DH-Parameters, I end up like this: 

As far as I understand, on non parallel axis the information is not lost because the measurement of a/d would be diagonal, therefore include either dX/dY, dX/dZ or dY/dZ(pythagorean theorem) in one parameter. 
Where is the flaw in my logic?

7578,Orientation parameter for quadcopter with madgwick fusion algorithm,"I recently decided to build a quadricopter from scratch using Arduino and now I'm faced with an orientation estimation problem.
I bought a cheap 10DOF sensor with 3 axis magnetometer, 3 axis accelerometer, 3 axis gyro and a barometer and the complementary filter that I use to get orientation returns usable but noisy values.
I tried the Madgwick fusion filter too, but it returns unstable values that diverges from the ones I get with complementary filter. Given that the Madgwick filter implementation is correct, I pass acceleration values measured in Gs, gyro values measured in rps (radians per second) and Magnetometer values measured in uT, while sampling time is the same of my loop cycle. Is there anything I have missed?
Is there any advantage using Kalman filter?
EDIT1:
My problem was due to an wrong choice of sampling time and now seems to work, but convergence is very very slow (i.e. it takes about 3 seconds to reach the right value after a quick flip of the IMU). Rising value of Kp adds to much noise. I also tried to repeat filter update step more than once per cycle but it requires too much time exceeding the sampling time.
Here some graphs, from top to bottom Complementary filter, Madgwick filter and Madgwick filter with high Kp:

Different values probably are caused by cable plug and unplug. Anyway raw data example from my sensor can be downloaded here

7640,PID gains for motor position and velocity control,"I have a servo motor with quad optical encoder and I'm trying to control its position and velocity. By controlling both I meant that if I input that the motor should reach 90 at 200rpm then it should. How can I do that? I am using an Arduino Uno. Kindly share some code if possible. 
Though I have implemented the PID, I don't think it is correct because I didn't implement the feedforward controller (because I have no idea what that is) and I have not been able to find suitable gains for PID. The gains I find for small steps (or say degree rotation) do not work out well for large steps and vice versa. I have also not used a limit for integral sum (because I don't how much it should be).

7644,How to use a POMDP-based planner on top of a probabilistic filter,"POMDPs extend MDPs by conceiling state and adding an observation model. A POMDP controller processes either

action/observation histories or
a bayesian belief state, computed from the observations (belief-MDP transformation)

In a complex, real-world system like a robot, one usually preprocesses sensory readings using filters (Kalmann, HMM, whatever). The result of which is a belief-state.
I am looking for publications that discuss the problem of fitting a (probably more abstract) POMDP model on top of an existing filter-bank. 

Do you have to stick to the belief-MDP, and hand over the filtered belief-state to the controller?
Is there any way of using history-based POMDP controllers, like MCTS?
How do you construct/find the abstract observations you need to formulate the POMDP model?

Up till now I have processed the bitmap image, and converted it into an adjacency list. I will now use the dijkstra's algorithm to plan the path.
However the problem is that I have to extract the entrance point/node and exit node from the bmp image itself for dijkstra's algorithm to plan the path.
The robots starting position will be slightly different (inch or two before the entrance point) from the entrance point of maze, and I am supposed to move to the entrance point using any ""arbitrary method"" and then apply dijkstra algorithm to plan path from maze's entrance to exit.
On the way I have to also stop at the ""X's"" marked in the bmp file I have attached below. These X's are basically boxes in which I have to pot balls. I will plan the path from entrance point to exit point , and not from the entrance to 1st box, then to second, and then to the exit point; because I think the boxes will always be placed at the shortest path.
Since the starting position is different from the entrance point, how will I match my robot's physical location with the coordinates in the program and move it accordingly. Even if the entrance position would have been same as starting position there may have been an error. How should I deal with it? Should I navigate only on the bases of the coordinates provided by dijkstra or use ultrasonics as well to prevent collisions? And if we yes, can you give me an idea how should I use the both (ultrasonics, and coordinates)?

Which requires a description of the arm in DH parameters, multiplying out the kinematics equation, partial differentiation w.r.t. each DH parameter, then a least-squares fit (with the left pseudo-inverse), then iterate.  
Is there some fundamental reason why DH parameters are used instead of a different representation (like xyz + euler angles).  I understand that there are fewer parameters (4 versus 6 or more), but for a calibration procedure like this I will be taking much more data than unknowns anyway.  All the robotics textbooks i have read just present DH parameters and say ""this is what you should use"", but don't really go into why.

I have placed a toggle switch that cuts the VCC to the servo board, so technically it should no longer produce any PWM signal, however when the power is cut, the ESC jumps to 100% throttle, I can only assume this is because the ESC believes the signal is 100% duty cycle, but how do I solve this?

7778,Electric Motor Speed Control - PWM vs analog voltage?,"I'm working on a 2-wheeled robot and have connected up a raspberry pi to an L298N motor driver.
I'm sending the enable pin of a particular motor a software-generated PWM signal at 100Hz with a 50% duty cycle.  I observe with an osciloscope:

a fairly clean square wave going into the enable pin as expected.
a fairly dirty square wave across the output motor terminals.

The motor turns at about 50% speed/torque as expected.
I find myself wondering if it would be better to control the speed of the motor by placing a flat lower constant voltage across its terminals, rather than oscillating a square wave.  ie to do 50% speed/torque - instead of oscilating between 0V and 5V - just put a constant 2.5V across the motor terminals.  I wonder if the oscillation is a waste of power/energy.
Is this true?  Or doesn't it make any difference?  Do high-end motor drivers use a variable flat analog voltage to control speed/torque, or do they use a PWM?  If a PWM, does the frequency make any difference?

7781,How do I decide the size of the time steps between sensing and control actuation?,"My Background:
My experience is in solid mechanics and FEA.  So I have zero experience in robotics/controls.  
Problem Description
I'm developing a control strategy to stabilize a complicated 6-legged dynamical system.  Torques Ti from each leg's joints will be used to create a net moment M on the body, stabilizing the system.  This moment M is known from the pre-determined control strategy.  (Side note: the dynamical solver is of the nonlinear computational type)
Due to my lack of background, I have a fundamental confusion with the dynamical system.  I want to use joint torques Ti to create this known net moment M on the body.  This moment M is a function of the

current positions/angles of all the leg segments
reaction forces and moments (that cannot be controlled) of each leg
controllable joint torques Ti of each leg
time

$(*)$ At a given time $(n-1)\Delta$t: 

--From the control strategy, the desired net moment M is computed/known
--One can read/sense the legs' positions, angles, reaction forces, and reaction moments (say, from well placed sensors), at this time $t = (n-1)\Delta$t.  
--From this information, vector algebra easily yields the desired joint torques Ti required to create the net moment M

$(**)$ At the time $(n)\Delta$t:

--one applies the previously determined joint torques Ti (determined at $t=(n-1)\Delta$t) to create the desired moment M 
--of course these torques Ti are applied at the immediate proceeding time step because they cannot be applied instantaneously

So this is exactly where my fundamental confusion exists.  The torques Ti were calculated in $(*)$, based on data of angles/positions/reactions in $(*)$, with the objective to create moment M.  However, these torques Ti are applied in $(**)$, where the data (angles/positions/reactions) are now different - thus the desired net moment M can never be created (unless you an magically apply actuation at the instantaneous time of sensing).  Am I understanding the controls problem correctly?  
Questions

Am I understanding the robotics problem correctly?  What are the terms and strategies around this dilemma?
Of course I could create the time steps between the sensing and the actuation to be infinitely small, but this would be unrealistic/dishonest.  What is the balance between a realistic time step, but also performs the task well?

7786,Which joints to discretize for IK,"I am using ikfast in OpenRave for my inverse kinematics.  This is an analytical solver, so if your robot's DOF matches the IK type's DOF, then you get all possible solutions.  But if your robot has more DOFs, then you need to pick some joints to have a constant value.  (However, if you use OpenRave's Python interface it will discretize that joint for you.  i.e. give you a set of solutions for every 0.1 radians of that joint.  But my question holds for either interface.)  I have a 7 DOF anthropomorphic arm with joints: Roll-Pitch-Roll-Pitch-Roll-Pitch-Yaw as seen in this image:

The discretized joints are call ""free joints"" in OpenRave's terminology.  If I let ikfast decide, it picks joint 3 (upper arm roll) to be the free joint.  However, I have been using joint 4 (elbow) to be the free joint because it is easier for me to think about.  But then I realized that perhaps joint 5, 6, or 7 would be better to discretize because they are closer to the end of the chain.  Won't the IK solutions suffer if joints closer to the start of the chain have a large discretization?  Or is OpenRave picking the optimal joint to discretize?
I was just wondering if there is some standard practices or known conventions for this sort of thing.
Put simply: I want a set of IK solutions for the end-effector at some pose.  I will fix a joint either near the start or end of the kinematic chain.  And what i set it to isn't going to be perfect.  Lets say it is off from some ""ideal"" position by some epsilon.  Now you can imagine that if i want the hand in-front of the robot, and I pick a bad angle for the shoulder (like straight up for example), the rest of the joints will have a hard time getting the end-effector to the target pose, if at all.  But If I fix the wrist to be at some awkward angle, there is still a good chance of getting the end-effector there, or at lease close.  What kind of trade-offs are there?  Which will have a ""better"" set of solutions?

7790,How to control motor speed via neural network on a dsPIC?,"I would like to seek some advise on how I should go about implementing a neural network on a dsPIC to control the motor speed of a robot (if it is at all feasible). Currently, I am deploying a typical PID control loop to control the speed of the motors that have encoders attached to them. 
Here are some thoughts on what I think the set-up should be like:
Inputs -> Desired Speed, Current Speed
Output -> PWM
Hidden -> Not sure how many nodes are needed and how many layers
I also face a contradiction on how to do supervised learning for this. Assuming I pass in a desired speed and the current speed, the output,if using sigmoid function, would be from 0-1. I would take this an multiply by the maximum PWM value then compare to the PWM value required to generate that speed. Is this the correct way to determine the error? I am a little unclear on this part. Technically, I could manually determine the PWM values required for certain speeds, but that would result in a very small data set for training. 
Alternatively, I considered passing the PWM values into the motor function, wait short period, then capture the current speed of the motor then compare that with the desired speed to get an error. 
I only just started coding some basic neural nets and I hope to get some ideas.

7802,EKF-SLAM initialize new landmark in covariance matrix,"I am trying to implement an EKF-SLAM using the algorithm for unknown correspondences proposed in the book ""Probalistic Robotics"" by Sebastian Thrun in Table 10.2 . 
By now I understand actually all of the algorithm except of the initialization of new landmarks in the covariance matrix $ P_{new} $. 
In that algorithm when a new landmark is detected the procedure is just the same as if a normal measurment update for an already observed landmark is done: the Kalman gain $ K $ is calculated for the new landmark and then the covariance is updated with that Kalman gain and the jacobian $ H $ of that new landmark like this $ P_{new}=  (I  -  K * H) * P$ . 
In my understanding a just new observed landmark would not have any effect on the rows and columns that correspond to already mapped landmarks or the robot pose in the covariance matrix. Instead I think that just two rows and columns for x and y should be created with some uncertainity like proposed here: the uncertainty of initializing new landmark in EKF-SLAM .
I tried to split down the calculation of $ P_{new}$ via claculating it blockwise to see if I could somehow come to the same initialization as shown in the link above. But I end up having a different covariance matrix where apparently the new landmark is effecting the rows and columns of the parts of the old covariance, which in my view can't be right.
I hope I don't understand the pseudo code of the book wrong or I did a mistake in my try to come to the same initialization. Any advice how the initialization of new lnndmarks work in that code or if it actually is the same as in the link will be appreciated.
Edit
So basically what I am asking is: why would they do a normal Kalman update of the covariance matrix in line 24 of table 10.2 for a new observed landmark? Why is there no explicit case for the initialization of new rows/columns of new observed landmarks in the covariance matrix? It seems to me like they just do a normal measurement update even for a just newly observed landmark.

7803,Gyroscope - How can I remove low frequency component with a high pass filter only?,"I'm using Matlab to suppress low frequency components with a high pass filter. 
Objective

Filter angular velocity measurements affected by high frequency noise and bias in order to get the best estimate of the angular position.

The output when the gyroscope is still looks like this.

First Approach
The easiest way to remove baseline is to remove the average and can be achieved with Matlab using one line of code.

Second Approach
We can design a high pass filter to attenuate low frequency components. If we analyze the frequency components of the signal we will see one peak at low frequency and ""infinite"" small components in all frequencies due to Noise. With a second order ButterWorth filter with normalized cutoff freq Wn = 0.2 we will get what we are looking for.

Filtered data

Tilting the Gyro
When we tilt the gyroscope the situation changes. With a sampling frequency of 300Hz we get the following plot.

The first half of the dft is shown below in a normalized scale.

You can find the sample.mat file here
The first approach works great. I would like to apply the second one to this particular case but here there are other low frequency components that make to job harder.
How can I apply the second approach based on the High Pass filter to remove the bias?
EDIT 1 
You can find more information here
EDIT 2
How can we filter this signal to remove bias while keeping the angular velocity information (from 110-th to 300-th sample) intact?
If gyroscopes have the bias problem only when they are not experiencing any rotation, then the offset is present only in the first ~110 samples.
If the above hypothesis is correct, maybe if we apply high pass filtering only in the first 110 samples and desactivate the filter during rotations of the gyro, the estimated angular position will be more accurate.

Using just the GPS position has noisy/jump samples and also the degradation due to multi-path near trees etc. From reading about filtering solutions, I understand that sensor fusion that fuses GPS with the data from inertial sensors (INS) helps improve a lot of these issues.

Class MPU6050 reads the data from the sensor, processes it. Class Kalman is the implementation of the Kalman filter. The problem is the next: None of the Kalman, neither the Complementary filter returns appropriate angle values from the Y angle. The filters work fine on the X angle, but the Y angle values make no sense. See the graphs below. I've checked the code million times, but still can't figure out where the problem is.  

EDIT:
I've added some information based on @Chuck's answer:

self.result_list[3] contains the temperature
In my opinion the compl. filter is implemented correctly: gyro_x_scaled and gyro_y_scaled are angular velocities, but they are multiplied by dt, so they give angle. acc_?_scaled are accelerations, but acc_x_angle and acc_x_angle are angles. Check my comment, where the Complementary filter tutorial is.
Yes, there was something missing in the Kalman filer, I've corrected it.
I totally agree with you, sleep(dt) is not the best solution. I've measured how much time the calculation takes, and it is about 0.003 seconds. The Y angle filters return incorrect values, even if sleep(0.007) or sleep(calculatedTimeDifference) is used.

To explain the system briefly, it consists of two cameras and each has its own GPS/IMU module. The main assumption is that Camera1 is fixed and stable, whereas camera2 has a noisy pose in 3D. I am using computer vision to obtain the pose (metric translation and rotation) of camera2 w.r.t. camera1, so that I can improve upon the inherent noise of GPS/IMU modules.
The problem here is that the translation obtained through the vision method is only up to an arbitrary scale, i.e. at any given instant, I can only obtain a unit vector that specifies the ""direction"" of the translation and not absolute metric translation. The camera based estimation, although accurate, has no idea about how much actual distance is between the cameras, which is why I have the GPS, which gives me position data with some noise.
Example: camera 2 is 5 m to the east of camera 1, the pose from my vision algorithm would say [1, 0, 0] ; 1 m north-east to camera 1, it would be something like [0.7, 0.7, 0]
Hence, would it be possible to consider the GPS estimate of the metric translation as well as its covariance ellipse, and somehow link it with the normalized camera measurements to obtain a final, more accurate estimate of metric translation? I am not sure what kind of filters would be happy to use a measurement that has no absolute value in it.

System description

Here comes a very simple system: $\mbox{Output}(t) = k * (\mbox{Input}(t) + \mbox{systemVariable}(t))$. $k$ is constant and $\mbox{systemVariable}(t)$ is a system variable which may change according to time.
The goal of the whole system is to maintain system output at $0$. It has to be as close to zero as possible. The controller has to compensate the $\mbox{systemVariable}$.
The change ($\mbox{systemVariable}$ ) is modeled by a very slow ramp.

Controller description

The controller's input is the output of the system. However, the measurements are always noisy, and I modeled Band-Limited White Noise into the measurements.
After PID controller, the output goes into an integrator, since the PID controller always calculates the ""change"" of the plant input. 

Questions

My original thoughts: Add a PID controller with P=1/k is enough. Since every time the controller gets an error $e$, it can be calculated back that the compensation on controller output shall be $e/k$. However, Matlab auto-tuning always give me a PID. Why is that?
What is the relation between P of PID and measurement noises? If P is large, the system will tend to be rambling largely, due to the noises. If P is small, the system will tend not to converge to the correct value or very slow. How to make the trade-offs? Or how to prevent system from rambling largely and get quick system responses?

Kinematics Equations for Differential Drive and Articulated Steering
by Thomas Hellstrm?

Note that plugging in $r$ and $v$ for both left and right wheel result in the same $\omega $ (otherwise the wheels would move relative to each other). Hence, the following equations hold:
$$
\begin{align}
\omega~ \left(R+\frac{l}{2}\right) &= v_r\\
\omega~ \left(R-\frac{l}{2}\right) &= v_l\\
\end{align}$$
where $R$ is the distance between ICC and the midpoint of the wheel axis, and $l$ is the
  length of the wheel axis (see Figure 6).

  When left and right wheel rotate with different speeds, the robot rotates around
  a common point denoted ICC
  My questions are:


How do these equations come to be?
Why does $\omega$ have to be same if we want to analyse the behavior after changing the wheel velocity relative to other?
How do we know about the circle, in which the robot rotates by doing variations in one wheel velocity, surely passes through the center point between two wheels.

So I'm looking for a lightweight dispenser mechanism capable of deliver small amounts of this fluid (3g) distributed on the trees canopy.

7883,How can I get the values of a IMU from the serial message received in Simulink via UART?,"I try to read IMU sensor data from an Arduino mega 2560 UART with serial receive block of Arduino support package for simulink. The IMU can send binary packets and also nmea packets and I can configure it to any output. When the serial recieve block output is directly used, it displays just the numbers between 0-255. l need help about how to parse the coming data which contains the euler angles that I want to use.
Here is binary structure ;
""s"",""n"",""p"",packet type(PT),Address,Data Bytes (D0...DN-1),Checksum 1,Checksum 0
The PT byte specifies whether the packet is a read or a write operation, whether it is a batch operation, and the length of the batch operation (when applicable). The PT byte is also used by the UM7 to respond to commands. The specific meaning of each bit in the PT byte is given below.
Packet Type (PT) byte;
7 Has Data,
6 Is Batch,
5 BL3,
4 BL2,
3 BL1,
2 BL0,
1 Hidden,
0 CF
Packet Type (PT) Bit Descriptions;
7...Has Data: If the packet contains data, this bit is set (1). If not, this bit is cleared (0). 
6...Is Batch: If the packet is a batch operation, this bit is set (1). If not, this bit is cleared (0) 
5:2..Batch Length (BL): Four bits specifying the length of the batch operation. Unused if bit 7 is cleared. The maximum batch length is therefore 2^4 = 16 
1...Hidden: If set, then the packet address specified in the Address field is a hidden address. Hidden registers are used to store factory calibration and filter tuning coefficients that do not typically need to be viewed or modified by the user. This bit should always be set to 0 to avoid altering factory configuration.
0...Command Failed (CF): Used by the autopilot to report when a command has failed. Must be set to zero for all packets written to the UM7.
The address byte specifies which register will be involved in the operation. During a read operation (Has Data = 0), the address specifies which register to read. During a write operation (Has Data = 1), the address specifies where to place the data contained in the data section of the packet. For a batch read/write operation, the address byte specifies the starting address of the operation.
The ""Data Bytes"" section of the packet contains data to be written to one or more registers. There is no byte in the packet that explicitly states how many bytes are in this section because it is possible to determine the number of data bytes that should be in the packet by evaluating the PT byte.
If the Has Data bit in the PT byte is cleared (Has Data = 0), then there are no data bytes in the packet and the Checksum immediately follows the address. If, on the other hand, the Has Data bit is set (Has Data = 1) then the number of bytes in the data section depends on the value of the Is Batch and Batch Length portions of the PT byte.
For a batch operation (Is Batch = 1), the length of the packet data section is equal to 4*(Batch Length). Note that the batch length refers to the number of registers in the batch, NOT the number of bytes. Registers are 4 bytes long.
For a non-batch operation (Is Batch = 0), the length of the data section is equal to 4 bytes (one register). The data section lengths and total packet lengths for different PT configurations are shown below.
The two checksum bytes consist of the unsigned 16-bit sum of all preceding bytes in the packet, including the packet header.
Read Operations;
To initiate a serial read of one or more registers aboard the sensor, a packet should be sent to the UM7 with the ""Has Data"" bit cleared. This tells the device that this will be a read operation from the address specified in the packet's ""Address"" byte. If the ""Is Batch"" bit is set, then the packet will trigger a batch read in which the ""Address"" byte specifies the address of the first register to be read.
In response to a read packet, the UM7 will send a packet in which the ""Has Data"" bit is set, and the ""Is Batch"" and ""Batch Length"" bits are equivalent to those of the packet that triggered the read operation. The register data will be contained in the ""Data Bytes"" section of the packet.

7886,How to numerically calculate the Jacobian?,"I'm trying to calculate the Jacobian for days now. But first some details. Within my Master's Thesis I have to numerically calculate the Jacobian for a tendon-driven continuum Robot. I have all homogeneous transformation matrices as I already implemented the kinematics for this Robot. Due to it's new structure there are no discrete joint variables anymore but rather continuous parameters. Therefore I want to compute the Jacobian numerically.
It'd be awesome if someone could provide a detailed way how to compute the numerical Jacobian for a 6-DoF rigid-link robot (only rotational joints => RRRRRR). From that I can transfer it to the continuum robot.
I've already started computing it. Let T be the homogeneous transformation matrix for the Endeffector (Tip)  with
$$T=\begin{bmatrix}R & r \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} $$
with R = rotational matrix (contains orientation) and $ r = \begin{bmatrix} x & y & z \end{bmatrix}^T$ endeffector position.
My approach is to compute the first three rows of J by successively increasing the joints, computing the difference to the ""original"" joint values and dividing it by the increment delta, the joint-space is $ q = \begin{bmatrix} q_1 & q_2 &  q_3 & ... &q_6 \end{bmatrix}T $
$q_1 = q_1 + \delta$ => $J(1,1) = (X_{increment} - X_{orig})/\delta$ 
$q_2 = q_2 + \delta$ => $J(1,2) = (X_{increment} - X_{orig})/\delta$   
and so on. I do the same for the y and z coordinates. So I get the first 3 rows of J. 
Now I don't know how to compute the last three rows as they refer to the rotational Matrix R. Since it's a 3x3 matrix and no scalar value I don't know how to handle it.

7889,Forward kinematics of constrained double pendulum,"I was wondering whether maybe you could help me with this problem. I have a double pendulum. I have set the origin of cartesian coordinates to be the ""head"" of the first arm, which is fixed. The end of the second arm is attached to a block that slides along the x-axis. What I want to do is to derive the equations relating the pendulum's angles with the distance from the origin to the block. 
Now, I know how I could go about deriving the equations without the constraint. 
$$x_1 = L_1cos(a_1)$$
$$y_1 = L_1sin(a_1)$$
Where $x_1$ and $y_1$ is where the first arm joins the second arm and $a_1$ is the angle between the horizontal and the first arm. 
Similarly, I can derive the equations for the end of the second arm 
$x_2 = x_1 + L_2 cos(a_2)$ and $y_2 = y_1 - L_2 sin(a_2)$
Now then, if I attach a sliding block to the end of my second arm, I don't know whether my equation for $x_2$ would change at all. I don't think it would but  would I have to somehow restrict the swing angles so that the block only moves along the x direction? 
Well, basically the problem is finding the equation of $x_2$ if it's attached to a block that only moves along the x- direction.

No matter how I adjust the parameters I can't seem to get rid of the oscillation in the velocity of the joint (seen in the second plot).

If I want to align robot in the direction of the target coordinates, I've to calculate atan2 between target and current coordinates.

The path points is as show below in the image, is my initial heading angle assumption is correct? 
'1' is the starting point.

Thank you for your patience and time, I'm still struck at turning, my code goes like this

My question is, is it better to use one big EKF (state vector containing all estimated variables) or multiple smaller EKFs (each one responsible for tracking a subset of all variables to be estimated)? Or is there no difference?
As for the example above, the EKF could be split into one for tracking position, one for estimating wheel radius and slip and one for estimating IMU biases. The position EKF would of course use the estimations output from the other concurrent EKFs and vice versa.
To me it seems it would be easier to tune and test multiple smaller EKFs rather than just one big. Are there any other advantages/disadvantages (execution time, ease of debugging etc.) assuming the resulting estimates are equal in the two approaches (or close enough at least)?

A Hokuyo lidar for localization and obstacle avoidance
A Kinect to see obstacles which can not be seen by the Hokuyo. 
Amcl for localization.
A couple of sharp sensors on the side for wall following. 

I am not planning to use the global or local costmap because the localization of the robot is not perfect and the robot might think that it is closer (or further away) to the wall than it actually is and therefore, wall following might fail. So, I am planning to just use the data from Hokuyo lidar and sharp sensors to do wall following and maintain constant distance from the wall (say 10 cm). 
Now, I would like to know what is the best technique for doing wall following in this manner? Also, how can one deal with the issue of open gaps in the wall (like open doors, etc..) while doing wall following using the above approach?
I know this is a very general question but any suggestions regarding it will be appreciated. Please let me know if you need more information from me.
Update:
I am just trying to do wall following in a given room (I have the vertices of the room in a global reference frame) For example, Lets say I have a map of a room (shown below). I want to make the robot follow the wall very closely (say 10 cm from the wall). Also, if there is an open space (on bottom left), the robot should not go in the adjacent room but should keep on doing wall following in the given room (For this, I have the boundary limits of the room which I can use to make sure the robot is within the given room).
The approach which I am thinking is to come up with an initial global path (set of points close to the wall) for wall following and then make sure robot goes from one point to the next making sure that it always maintains a certain distance from the wall. If there is no wall, then the robot can just follow the global path (assuming localization is good). I am not sure about its implementation complexity and whether there is a better algorithm/ approach to do something like this.

$$ n_A = Xn_B $$ where $n_A$, $n_B$ are the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue of 1 for the $A$ and $B$ rotations.

The actual transform is the one that I had based my $A$ and $B$ data on. Then I tried implementing the Tsai-Lenz and Horaud and Dornaika's Nonlinear optimization techniques using LM solver but to no avail. I do not get the correct transformation out of any of the solvers.

7966,Orthogonal projection of laserscanner data,"I recently discovered this ROS-package:  .
Which is basically exactly what I need. However I am not using ROS, so I need to do what is been done in this package myself.
Basically the information I have is the range measurement r and the angle theta for every measurement point of a 360 degree laserscan + I have the orientation in roll, pitch, yaw angles of the laserscanner. However yaw is not important for me and could be ignored.
I really can't get my head around how to project those points to the ground plane. I mean it is easy for the measurement point which align with the roll and pitch axes, but I don't know what to do with the points in between :D
One solution I thought of is this:

Convert the measurement point (r, theta) in cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) - vector
Use rotations matrices: create rotation matrix for rotation around roll axis with roll angle, and adequately for the pitch axis. Multiplay bot matrices and then multiply it with (x,y,z) - vector.
Now the orthogonal projection of the of the measurement would be the (x,y,z) - vector with z=0.
Convert (x,y) - vector back to polar coordinates (r, theta).

However, especially step 2 is very complicated, because the rotation matrices change according to the sign of the roll and pitch angles, right?
I would like to note that the absolute value of role and pitch angles will always be < 90, so there should not be an unambiguity with rotations..
Is there an easier (or maybe more elegant) way to solve my problem?
My guess is, that this problem must have been solved basically for every robot application which uses a 2D-laserscanner that is not fixed to one axis. 
But I can not find the solution anywhere.
So I would be very glad if anyone of you could point me in the right direction.
Kind regards

7968,What PID values should i keep,"I have built quadcopter but the problem is of balancing. It doesnt goes up. I am using PID techniqe for balancing. But i am not finding the suitable values for PID tuning. I am using mpu6050 as a sensor. I get the accelerometer values of x and y axis and find the error from them. That is lets say if accel on x is not zero then it error cause it should be zero if balanced. I am using +-2g sensitivity scale of accelerometer. The motors i am using are dji 920 kva. What values for kp, ki and kd should i set. I cant set them while in flight cause it completely out of balance.

This is the design. Completely home made. I have modified it a little after this photo. Accelerometer is at 2g so at balance z will be 32768/2 .

There are also few more questions, should i scale error or pid output, because error is from ranging from 0 to 16380 at 2g setting, so i am scaling it from 0 to 42. So should i divide error or pid by some value?

7972,Air hockey with a robot as an opponent,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but here goes.
So, as the title states, I'm planning on building a desk that doubles as an air hockey table which has a robot on the other side.
The robot would be mounted on a rail which should be able to go left and right using a linear actuator. It should be able to ""attack"" the puck using two servos.
The real problem is how should I detect the puck's location?
My idea:
Since the table would have tiny holes in the corners of a every square(0.5inx0.5in), I could fit in a laser on the bottom part of the table, a laser for ever 1in so a 1inx1in square, the same location would be reflected on the ""ceiling"" of the table but instead of laser diodes, they would be replaced by an ldr. 
So I'm planning on doing a matrix and reading the signals of the ldr's columns and rows then performing some logic to locate the center of the puck.
PROBLEMS:
While I don't see any performance flaws in my plan, I see tons of flaws when done imperfectly even to the tiniest bit.

I have to be exactly accurate regarding the laser diode's position,
it has to be on the center of the holes, right below the z-axis.
This should be easy if I'm just going to place 4 or 5. But I'm not.
According to my estimations, I'm going to have to use 300-700 laser
diodes, depending on if I'm planning on putting the lasers only on
the opponent's side or on the entire board. It would definitely be
costly. Imagine 300...
This isn't really a huge problem, more like a hassle. Wiring 300 of
these. Forget the pcbs, the project area is just to large.

I have thought of numerous way to lessen these, like using a color sensor to get the x-axis location and a laser situated on a negative x-axis pointing to the positive x-axis to locate the puck's y location, but I'm still comparing ideas.
Advantages:
I could get a 3d-like graphical representation with 3d-like controls (3d-like in reality but technically 2d since the lasers are only plotted in the x and y axis though facing the z-axis). 
Since this project is going to be my room desk, situated in an automated room, I was thinking of making ""desk modes"" which should toggle between a game that takes advantage of the lasers and their controls, A control desk for my room, ordinary desk mode, and an air hockey mode.
My question: (More like a request)
Does anyone have another idea regarding how I should be able to locate the puck's x and y location accurately in real time?
EDIT: The table is roll-able and stored underneath a loft bed which has an under-area height of 5'4"". Which means I can't go grande on the a vertical solution.
EDIT #2: Thanks to the helpful people here, I have come to the conclusion of using a camera.
The camera will be that of a smartphone's, I'll create an app that tracks an object by color and a has fixed size comparison to identify the distance of the robot from the puck. The phone will then process this and send signals via bluetooth.
The phone is anchored at the end of the robot's moving part so the camera is reminiscent of those games with a first-person view.
Incoming problems: I'm looking forward to some delay, given the delay in processing.

7983,"Magnetic, low insertion force connector","I'm building a robotic tea-maker/watchdog robot and have a power problem. I would like to be able to have the robot approach a socket and insert the power cord of a cheap immersion heater (120V, 300W, see links below) to turn the heater on. However, the power and precision required to plug it into the wall is beyond the capabilities of my stepper motors/Arduino. 
My solution was a magnetic breakaway power cord like the charger on a Mac but at higher voltage. Deep fat fryers have suitable ones (120V, high power, see links below). However, the problem is I need both sides of the connector, and I can only find the magnetic breakaway power cord, not the opposite side, which would normally be built into the deep fat fryer. I don't fancy buying a whole fryer just to get one little part...
Any ideas? Alternatives to a breakaway cord? Anyone know of any (cheap) 120V induction chargers? I'll resort to a mechanical on/off switch and just leave the robot plugged in if I have to, but I was hoping for something a bit sleeker.

While the motors thrust means to be its acceleraTion. The reason of my previous statment is that when the quad is static in air(not goin up nor below), that time the thrust is enough to cancel gravity, means thrust is negative gravity, that is acceleration. So if i add pid output to thrust that is acceleration of motors, it will be wrong. I have to add pid to speed of motors, which is not visible. My quad is not stabalizing the reason i see is this, that i am adding pid to acc, while it should be added to speed(virtually). What should i do. Should i derivate the pid output and add to thrust?

8008,Image Based Visual Servoing algorithm in MATLAB,"I was trying to implement the IBVS algorithm (the one explained in the Introduction here) in MATLAB myself, but I am facing the following problem : The algorithm seems to work only for the cases that the camera does not have to change its orientation in respect to the world frame.For example, if I just try to make one vertex of the initial (almost) square go closer to its opposite vertex, the algorithm does not work, as can be seen in the following image

The red x are the desired projections, the blue circles are the initial ones and the green ones are the ones I get from my algorithm.
Also the errors are not exponentially dereasing as they should.

What am I doing wrong? I am attaching my MATLAB code which is fully runable. If anyone could take a look, I would be really grateful. I took out the code that was performing the plotting.

I test on a simulator and the control works but becomes unstable in some cases (request for R: 60 P: 60 Y:60). I also want this to work around singularities (i.e. pitch 90)
Does anyone know why I get this behavior and if so explain (thoroughly) what I'm doing wrong?

8027,How to sumarize Kalman filter covariances for display?,"I'm implementing an extended Kalman filter and I'm facing a problem with showing the covariances to the user.
The covariance matrix estimate contains all the information we have about the current value estimate, but that is too much to display.
I would like to have a single number that says ""our estimate is really good"" when close to 0 and ""our estimate is not worth much"" when large.
My intuitive simple solution would be to average all the values in the covariance estimate matrix (or maybe just the diagonal), except that in my case the values have different units and different ranges.
Is it possible to do something like this?

8051,Maximum ball screw speeds,"What is the maximum rotational velocity of miniature ball-screw (diameters up to 12mm) for approximately 1000 thrust cycles, and which type/brand would that be, if the speed is limited by the ball return mechanism? The fastest I could find was 4000 rpm at 3000 N thrust, but this was from a datasheet with a big safety margin (millions of cycles).
I'm looking for either experience and data, or a general method/formula that can be used to find the maximum velocity (and load) as function of cycles or the other way round (similar to those of ball bearings). Suggestions and knowledge about faster types and brands of ballscrews than the ones I have been able to find is welcome as well.
Some more background information:
Ball screws are very interesting transmissions for electrically actuated legged robotics, since they provide a high-geared rotary-to-linear transmission that is accurate, precise, energy efficient and possibly backlash-free. However, the big downside is their limited rotational speed. The maximum rotational velocity is limited by resonance and the ball return mechanism. The former limit is easy to calculate (eigenfrequency calculation), and mostly not problematic for small spindles. However, the latter is a bigger problem. The balls in a ball screw roll through the threaded spindle and have to be recirculated to the other end of the nut. The recirculation limits the rotational velocity of the ballscrews. The corresponding maximum rotational velocities are not calculate-able (for as far as I know) and are provided by manufacturers in catalogues, either directly in rpm or via a so-called $D_n$-value, where the rotational velocity in rpm is $n=D_n/d$ where d is the diameter of the ball screw. But even then, the maximum rotational velocity of ball screws is capped at 4000 rpm or lower according to datasheets (depending on brand and ball return mechanism). The highest permissible rotational velocities I found were those of Steinmeyer ballscrews, at 4000 rpm, using an end-cap-return mechanism. Note that for electrical motors (up to 200W) ideal (maximum power) velocities are higher than 4000 rpm, and even more than twice as high for many brushless motors. It appears however that ball screws can run at higher speeds than what they are specified for in reality, because the specifications hold for many millions of cycles. I can only find a single unofficial source where someone claims to have run their ball-screws up to 6000 rpm, and in missiles (one-time-use) up to 7500 rpm. I'm interested in a theory or more experimental data that backs this up.

However, i'm not sure if this rapid acceleration should correlate with higher torque motors or faster speed motors.  I think higher torque motors would be too slow to react to control commands.  In contrast, fast speed motors may not be able to overcome the momentum of the cart.

8058,Optimal-time acceleration sequence of a line-following robot following a moving obstacle,"Say we have a line-following robot that has a moving obstacle in front, that is a one-dimensional problem. The moving obstacle is defined by its initial state and a sequence of (longitudinal) acceleration changes (the acceleration function is piecewise constant). Let's say the robot can be controlled by specifying again a sequence of acceleration changes and its initial state. However, the robot has a maximum and minimum acceleration and a maximum and minimum velocity. How can I calculate the sequence of accelerations minimizing the time the robot needs to reach a goal. Note that the final velocity must not necessarily be zero.
Can you briefly explain how this problem can be addressed or point me to some references where an algorithm is described? Or point out closely related problems?
Furthermore, does the solution depend on the goal position or could the robot just brake as late as possible all the time (avoiding collisions) and still reach any goal in optimal time?
A more formal problem description:
Given the position of the obstacle $x_B(t) = x_{B,0} + \int_{t_0}^t v_B(t) dt$, and the velocity of the obstacle $v_B(t) = v_{B,0} + \int_{t_0}^t a_B(t) dt$, where $a_B$ is a known piecewise constant function:
$$a_B(t) = \begin{cases} a_{B,1} & \text{for } t_0 \leq t < t_1 \\
a_{B,2} & \text{for } t_1 \leq t < t_2 \\
\dots & \\
\end{cases}$$
and given the initial state of the line-follower $x_{A,0}, v_{A,0} \in \mathbb{R}$ we search for piecewise constant functions $a_A$, where $a_{min} \leq a_A(t) \leq a_{max}$, $v_{min} \leq v_A(t) \leq v_{max}$ and $x_A(t) \leq x_B(t)$ (collision freeness) holds at all times. Reasonable assumptions are e.g. $v_B(t) \geq 0$ and $x_{B,0} \geq x_{A,0}$. Among the feasible solutions I would like to pick those minimizing $\int_{t_0}^{\infty} x_B(t) - x_A(t) dt$ or a similar objective. Approximation algorithms are also ok.

8065,Solution for INS and GPS integration,"I have a GPS module and an IMU (gyro, accelerometer and magnetometer) and I need to build an autonomous navigation system for a quadcopter. It must know its position at any time so that it can track a predefined path. I know that, in order to improve precision, I need to merge both sensors data through a Kalman Filter (or any other technique for that matter, the thing is that the Kalman Filter is way more common according to my research).
The problem is that I am seriously stuck and I know this might be something very simple but I don't seem to find a solution or at least the answer for some of the most basic questions.
As a start, I know how to get the position from the accelerometer readings. I have some filters that help eliminate noise and minimize the integration errors. I also have the GPS readings in latitude and longitude. The first question is, during sensor fusion, how can I make both measurements compatible? The latitude and longitude from the GPS won't simply mix with the displacement given by the accelerometer, so what is the starting point for all of this? Should I calculate the displacement from the GPS readings or should I assume a starting latitude and longitude and then update it with the accelerometer prior to applying the filter?
I have once developed a simple Kalman Filter in which I could plug the new reading values to obtain the next estimate position of a two wheeled car. Now I have two sources of inputs. How should I merge those two together? Will the filter have two inputs or should I find a function that will somehow get the best estimate (average, maybe?) from the accelerometer and GPS? I am really lost here.
Do you guys have any examples of code that I could use to learn? It is really easy to find articles full of boxes with arrows pointing the direction in which data must flow and some really long equations that start to get confusing very soon such as those presented on this article:  (I have no problems with equations, seriously) but I have never seen a real life example of such implementation.

Do I have to use a rotation matrix to pass from the IMU frame to the robot frame coordinates?

8103,Overheating/Jamming MG996R servo,"I have recently purchased my first ever servo, a cheap unbranded Chinese MG996R servo, for 3.20 on eBay.

I am using it in conjunction with a Arduino Servo shield (see below):

As soon as it arrived, before even plugging it in, I unscrewed the back and ensured that it had the shorter PCB, rather than the full length PCB found in MG995 servos. So, it seems to be a reasonable facsimile of a bona-fide MG996R.
I read somewhere (shame I lost the link) that they have a limited life, due to the resistive arc in the potentiometer wearing out. So, as a test of its durability, I uploaded the following code to the Arduino, which just constantly sweeps from 0 to 180 and back to 0, and left it running for about 10 to 15 minutes, in order to perform a very simple soak test.

When I returned, the servo was just making a grinding noise and no longer sweeping, but rather it seemed to be stuck in the 0 position (or the 180). I picked the servo up and whilst not hot, it was certainly quite warm. A quick sniff also revealed that hot, burning motor windings smell.  After switching of the external power supply and allowing it to cool, the servo began to work again. However, the same issue occurred a little while later. Again, after allowing it to rest, upon re-powering, the servo continues to work.  However, I am reluctant to continue with the soak test, as I dont really want to burn the motor out, just yet.
Is there a common no-no of not making servos sweep from extreme to extreme, and one should play nice and just perform 60 sweeps, or is the cheapness of the servo the issue here?
I am powering the servo from an external bench supply, capable of 3A, so a lack of current is not the issue.

Please note that I also have a follow up question, Should a MG996R Servo's extreme position change over time?

8104,Should a MG996R Servo's extreme position change over time?,"This question is a follow on from my previous question, Overheating/Jamming MG996 servo.
I have recently purchased my first ever servo, a cheap unbranded Chinese MG996R servo, for 3.20 on eBay.

After mounting the servo horn and the bracket, I realised that I had not mounted the horn in a tout a fait 0 orientation, rather the angle between the bracket and the servo side was approximately 20. However, after switching the servo on and off a couple of times, with each time allowing the servo to perform, say, about 10 sweeps each time, I quickly noted that the servos extreme positions were changing over time, so that the initial extremes and then the extremes after about 5 on and off cycles, had changed by about 15, so that now, 0 and 180 the bracket is now parallel with the body of the servo. 
I was quite surprised at this, as I had assumed that the 0 and 180 positions would be fixed, and not change over time, or vary each time that it was switched on and off.
Seeing as there should be a stop peg on the gear connected to the potentiometer inside, how is this even possible?

8111,Multiple control loops with overlapping effects,"I'm familiar with using PID to perform closed loop control when there is a single output and a single error signal for how well the output is achieving the desired set-point.
Suppose, however, there are multiple control loops, each with one output and one error signal, but the loops are not fully independent.  In particular, when one loop increases its actuator signal, this changes the impact of the output from other loops in the system.
For a concrete example, imagine a voltage source in series with a resistor, applying a voltage across a system of six adjustable resistors in parallel.  We can measure the current through each resistor and we want to control the current of each resistor independently by adjusting the resistance.  Of course, the trick here is that when you adjust one resistor's resistance, it changes the overall resistance of the parallel set, which means it changes the voltage drop due to the divider with the voltage source's resistance and hence changes the current through the other resistors.
Now, clearly we have an ideal model for this system, so we can predict what resistance we should use for all resistors simultaneously by solving a set of linear equations.  However, the whole point of closed loop control is that we want to correct for various unknown errors/biases in the system that deviate from our ideal model.  The question then: what's a good way to implement closed loop control when you have a model with this kind of cross-coupling?

8116,Covariance and optimization,"I am trying to build a map containing lamps as landmarks. I drive around with a robot and a monocular camera looking to the ceiling.
The first step is detect the edges of each observed rectangular lamp and save the position in pixels and also the current position from odometry of the robot. After the lamp disappears from the field of view, there is enough base-line to do a 3D reconstruction based on structure from motion. Once this reconstruction is done there will be uncertainty in the position of the lamps that can be modelled by covariance. Imagine if the robot was driving for a while, its own position estimated from odometry will also have a relatively high incertitude, how can I integrate all of those incertitudes together in the final covariance matrix of the position of each lamp?
If I understand well there would be the following covariances:

noise from camera
Inaccurate camera calibration matrix
inaccurate result from optimization
drift in odometry

My goal is to manually do loop closure using for example g2o (graph optimization) and for that I think correct covariances are needed for each point.

8128,How to calculate the current consumed by a brushless motor on a quadcopter,"I want to create a virtual quadcopter model, but I am struggling to come up with a satisfying model for the brushless motors & props.
Let's take an example, based on the great eCalc tool:

Let's say I want to know how much current is consumed by the motor in a hovering state. I know the mass of the quad (1500g), so I can easily compute the thrust produced by each motor:

Thrust is produced by moving a mass of air at an average speed of V:
Thrust = 0.5 * rho * A * V

Where rho (air density) is 1.225kg/m3 and A (propeller disk area) is PI * Radius = 0.073m (12"" props). So I can compute V:
V = sqrt(Thrust / 0.5 / rho / A) = 9.07 m/s

All right, now I can calculate the aerodynamic power created by the propeller:
P = Thrust * V = 3.68 * 9.07 = 33.4 W

All right, now I can calculate the mechanical power actually produced by the motor. I use the PConst efficiency term from eCalc:
Pmec = Paero * PConst = 33.4 * 1.18 = 39.4W

Here, eCalc predicts 37.2W. It's not too far from my number, I imagine they use more sophisticated hypotheses... Fair enough.
From this post, I know that this power is also equal to:
Pmec = (Vin - Rm * Iin) * (Iin - Io)

Where I know Rm (0.08 Ohms) and Io (0.9 A). So, finally, my question: How do you calculate Vin and Iin from here? Of course, if I knew the rotation speed of the engine I could get Vin from:
n = Kv * Vin

Where Kv = 680 rpm/V. But unfortunately I don't know the rotation speed...
(Note that Vin is assumed to be averaged from the pulse-width-modulated output produced by the ESC)

My goal is to have the robot drive roughly parallel to a wall, side-scanning the entire time, and create a 2D map of that wall it is moving past. The 2D topography map is created post processing (I use R for much of my data processing, but I don't know is popular for this kind of work).
From what I know of it, SLAM sounds like a great tool for what I want to do. But I have two issues:
1: I know my robot will not have a consistent speed, and I have no way to predict or measure the speed of my robot. So I have no way to estimate the odometry of the robot.  
2: The robot will also move further and closer to the wall as it proceeds down it's path. So I can not depend on a steady plane of travel from my robot.
So given that I don't have any odometry data, and my realtive distance to the wall changes over the course of a run, is it possible to use SLAM to create 2D maps?

I'm trying to design the power system for a small 2-wheeled robot. Aside from the 2 main drive motors, it also has to power an Arduino, a Raspberry Pi and a couple small servos to actuate sensors.

the motors are each rated for 6V with a peak stall current of 2.2A
the Arduino uses about 5V@100mA
the Raspberry Pi uses about 5V@700mA
the servos each use 6V and have a peak stall current of 1.2A.

So the theoretical max current draw would be  = 7.6A.
Originally I was planning to use three separate Lipo batteries:

one 12V using a step-down converter to power the main drive motors for 6V@4.4A peak
two 3.7V lipos each with step-up converter (rated for 5v@3A) to handle the servos and logic separately

Then I discovered UBECs, which sound too good to be true, and they seem to be both cheap (<$10) and efficient (>90%) and able to handle my exact volt/current requirements.
Should I instead use a single high-current 12V lipo with three UBECs to independently power my drive motors, sensor motors and logic? Or will this still suffer from brown-out and power irregularities if a motor draws too much current?

Then I will find the PID gains that will control the robot and keep it balanced with the most optimum response. For the time being I am only interested in finding the transfer function for the dynamic model only.
Here is an example: 
However, I am not sure of my result.Here are the free body diagrams for the wheels and the inverted pendulum (robot body) and calculations below: 

Dynamic Equations:
$$
\begin{array}{lcr}
m_1 \ddot{x}_1 = F_r - F_{12} & \rightarrow & (1)& \\
m_2 \ddot{x}_2 = F_{12} & \rightarrow &  (2) &\\
J_1 \ddot{\theta}_1 = F_r r - \tau & \rightarrow & (3) &\\
J_2 \ddot{\theta}_2 = \tau - mgl\theta & \rightarrow & (4) & \mbox{(linearized pendulum)}\\
\end{array}
$$
Kinematics:
$$
x_1 = r\theta_1 \\
x_2 = r\theta_1 + l\theta_2 \\
$$
Equating (1) and (3):
$$
m_1 \ddot{x}_1 + F_{12} = F_r \\
\frac{J_1 \ddot{\theta}_1}{r} + \frac{\tau}{r} = F_r
$$
Yields:
$$
\frac{J_1 \ddot{\theta}_1}{r} - m_1 \ddot{x}_1 + \frac{\tau}{r} = F_{12} \rightarrow (5)
$$
Equating (5) with (2):
$$
\frac{J_1 \ddot{\theta}_1}{r} - m_1 \ddot{x}_1 + \frac{\tau}{r} - m_2 \ddot{x}_2  = 0 \rightarrow (6) \\
$$
Using Kinematic equations on (6):
$$
(J_1 - m_1 r^2 - m_2 r^2) \ddot{\theta}_1 + m_2 l r \ddot{\theta}_2 = -\tau \rightarrow (7) \\
$$
Equating (7) with (4):
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
\underbrace{(J_1 - m_1 r^2 - m_2 r^2) }\ddot{\theta}_1 &+& \underbrace{(m_2 l r + J_2 ) }\ddot{\theta}_2 &+& \underbrace{m_2 gl}\theta &= 0 \rightarrow (8) \\
A & &B & & C & \\
\end{array}
$$
Using Laplace transform and finding the transfer function:
$$
\frac{\theta_1}{\theta_2} = -\frac{Bs^2 + C}{As^2} \\
$$
Substituting transfer function into equation (7):
$$
(J_1 - m_1 r^2 - m_2 r^2) \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_2}\theta_2 s^2 + m_2 lr\theta_2 s^2 = -\tau \\
$$
Yields:
$$
\frac{_2}{} = \frac{-1}{(mlr-B) s^2+C}
$$
Simplifying:
$$
\frac{_2}{}=  \frac{1}{J_2 s^2-m_2 gl}
$$

-This only expresses the pendulum without the wheel i.e. dependent only on the pendulums properties.
-Poles are real and does verify instability.

The position data comes both from a very accurate optical tracking system (Vicon or similar) and an IMU.

The main problem is that both systems have different reference frames, so in order to compare I first need to align both reference frames. I have found several solutions; the general problem of aligning two datasets seems to be called ""the absolute orientation problem"".
My concern is that if I use any of these methods I will get the rotation and translation that aligns both datasets minimizing the error over the whole dataset, which means that it will also compensate up to some extent for the IMU's drift. But I am especially interested in getting a feeling of how much the IMU drifts, so that solution does not seem to be applicable.

8310,What is the required theory behind building a robotic arm?,"I am currently planning on building a robotic arm. The arm's specs are as follows: 

3 'arms' with two servos each (to move the next arm)
single servo clamp
mounted on revolving turntable
turntable rotated by stepper motor
turntable mounted on baseplate by ball bearings to allow rotation
baseplate mounted on caterpillar track chassis
baseplate is smaller in length and width than caterpillar chassis

What are the required formulas in determining how much torque each servo must produce, keeping in mind that the arm must be able to lift weights of up to 1 kilogram? Also, considering that the ball bearings will take the load of the arm, how strong does the stepper have to be (just formulas, no answers)?
As far as overall dimensions are concerned, the entire assembly will be roughly 255mm x 205mm x 205mm (l x w x h). I have not finalized arm length, but the aforementioned dimensions give a general estimate as to the size.

8313,Is modelling a robot and deriving its Equations of Motions more applicable to a system that is inherently unstable?,"As someone who is new and is still learning about robotics, I hope you can help me out.
Let's say I have two systems: 

(a) Inverted Pendulum (unstable system)
(b) Pole Climbing Robot (stable system)

For system (a), I would say that generally, it is a more dynamic system that produces fast motion. So, in order to effectively control it, I would have to derive the Equations of Motions (EOM) and only then I can supply the sufficient input to achieve the desired output. Eventually, the program will implement the EOM which enables the microcontroller to produce the right signal to get the desired output.
However for system (b), I assume that it is a stable system. Instead of deriving the EOM, why cant I just rely on the sensor to determine whether the output produced is exactly what I want to achieve? 
For unstable system, controlling it is just difficult and moreover, it does not tolerate erratic behavior well. The system will get damaged, as a consequence. 
On the contrary, stable system is more tolerant towards unpredictable behavior since it is in fact stable.
Am I right to think about it from this perspective? What exactly is the need for deriving the EOM of systems (a) and (b) above? What are the advantages?  How does it affect the programming of such systems?

8319,Filtering angular velocity spikes of a cheap Gyroscope,"I would like to filter angular velocity data from a ""cheap"" gyroscope (60$). These values are used as an input of a nonlinear controller in a quadcopter application. I am not interested in removing the bias from the readings.
Edit:
I'm using a
 l2g4200d gyroscope connected via i2c with an Arduino uno. The following samples are acquired with the arduino, sent via serial and plotted using matlab.
When the sensor is steady, the plot shows several undesired spikes.

How can I filter these spikes?
1st approach: Spikes are attenuated but still present...
Let's consider the following samples in which a couple of fast rotations are performed. Let's assume that the frequency components of the ""fast movement"" are the ones I will deal with in the final application.

Below, the discrete Fourier transform of the signal in a normalized frequency scale and the second order ButterWorth low pass filter.

With this filter, the main components of the signal are preserved. 

Although the undesired spikes are attenuated by a factor of three the plot shows a slight phase shift...

And the spikes are still present. How can I improve this result?
Thanks.
EDIT 2:
1./2. I am using a breakout board from Sparkfun. You can find the circuit with the Arduino and the gyro in this post: Can you roll with a L3G4200D gyroscope, Arduino and Matlab? 
    I have added pullup resistors to the circuit. I would exclude this option because other sensors are connected via the i2c interface and they are working correctly.
    I haven't any decoupling capacitors installed near the integrated circuit of the gyro. The breakout board I'm using has them (0.1 uF). Please check the left side of the schematic below, maybe I am wrong.

Motors have a separate circuit and I have soldered all the components on a protoboard.

The gyro is in the quadcopter body but during the test the motors were turned off.
That is interesting. The sampling frequency used in the test was 200Hz.  Increasing the update freq from 200 to 400 hz doubled the glitching.

8322,Need an idea: automated sim card switcher,"First off, sorry if my question is too naive or not related to the forum (this is the best matching one I've found on StackExchange).
I have some amount of SIM-cards. I can programmatically access a single SIM-card if it is inserted into a USB-modem. I want to be able to access the specified card in the set. The best way to achieve this I can think of is to create a device that would somehow replace the current card in the modem with one in the set. I can not use several modems for this because I don't really know the amount of cards and I would like to automate this process anyway.
I am more of a programmer than an engineer so everything that follows (including the entire concept of switching cards) looks pretty weird to me. There probably is a better solution, but this is the best I've come up with. For now I consider building some sort of conveyor that would move cards and insert the ones I need with some sort of a feed device. This looks like an overkill to me that would be both expensive to build and uneffective to work with.
I want an idea of a device that would replace SIM-cards into the modem (or maybe a better solution to the problem). Any disassembly of a modem needed is possible.

1/ While comparing professional arms (made by epson, staubli...) I noticed that the actuator used for the translation on the Z axis is at the end of the arm. On ""hobby"" arms like the makerarm project on kickstarter they use a leadscrew with the actuator at the beginning of the arm.
I thought it was smarter to put the actuator handling this DoF at the begining of the arm (because of its weight) and not at the end, but I assume that these companies have more experience than the company behind the makerarm. So I'm probably wrong, but I would like to understand why :)
2/ Also I would like to understand what kind of actuators are used in these arms. The flx.arm (also a kickstarter project) seems to be using stepper motors but they also say they are using closed loop control, so they added an encoder on the stepper motors right?
Wouldn't it be better to not use stepper and, for instance, use DC brushless motors or servos instead ?
3/ I also saw some of these arms using belts for the 2nd Z axis rotation, what is the advantage ? it only allows to put the actuator at the begining of the arm ?

Function to compose two poses ([x ; y ; theta])
function tac=tcomp(tab,tbc)
%Composition of transformations given by poses
ang = tab(3)+tbc(3);

if ang > pi | ang <= -pi
   ang = AngleWrap(ang);
end

s = sin(tab(3));
c = cos(tab(3));
tac = [tab(1:2)+ [c -s; s c]*tbc(1:2);

Function to get the inverse pose of a pose

tba = zeros(size(tab));
for t=1:3:size(tab,1),
   tba(t:t+2) = tinv1(tab(t:t+2));
end

SOLUTION:
To get the relative pose, we need to compute two things:

The pose to be composed with poseR1 to get poseR2.   It means that we need to get the ""pose_inc"" that satisfy with this equality
tcomp(psoeR1,**pose_inc**) = poseR2

The next code compute that relative pose that allows to poseR1 reach poseR2
% Computing the relative pose between R1 and R2

% pose to be composed with poseR1 to reach poseR2

pose_inc = tcomp(tinv(poseR1),poseR2);

The covariance matrix of the relative pose. The uncertainty of R1 after reach the position poseR2
    c = cos(poseR1(3)); s = sin(poseR1(3));

    x_1 = poseR1(1); y_1 = poseR1(2);

    x_2 = poseR2(1); y_2 = poseR2(2);

    % Jacobians to compute the covariance of the relative pose
    JacF_1 = [-c -s -(x_2-x_1)*s+(y_2-y_1)*c ;
               s -c -(x_2-c_1)*c-(y_2-y_1)*s ;

    % Computing the covariance of the relative pose
    C_p12 = JacF_1*co1*JacF_1' + JacF_2*co2*JacF_2';`


Roughly,
JacF_1 is a jacobian that define how difference poseR1 is against pose_inc
JacF_2 is a jacobian that define how difference poseR2 is against pose_inc
C_p12 is the covariance matrix of R1 after move to poseR2

Currently, I have this:

Structure;
an IMU (accelerometer, gyro, compass);
4 ESCs and DC motors;
4 propellers;
Raspberry Pi to control the system, and;
LiPo battery.

I have calibrated the ESCs and the four motors are already working and ready.
But now I am stuck.
I guess the next step is to dive deeply in the control system, but I am not sure where to begin. I read some articles about the control using PIDs, but I don't know how many should I use, or whether I need to model the quadrotor first to compute kinematic and dynamic of the quadrotor inside the RPi.
Sorry if the question is too basic!
More details
The structure is from a kit. Well, all I have now is the ESCs calibrated, although I do not have documentation of them to adjust the cut off voltage for the LiPo battery. I have been made tests with some Python code I found to have PWM outputs for the motors and to control I2C bus to communicate with IMU. 
One of my problems now is that I need RPIO library for PWM and the  to work with the I2C libraries from the MIT to control my IMU but as far as I know RPIO works with Python2 and quick2wire works with Python3 so I don't know how to manage this.
So actually, I have no code yet to control the four motors in parallel, only have testing code to test them separately and also with the IMU.
About the IMU, I am still learning how to work with it and how to use the MIT library. The unit includes those sensors:

ADXL345
HMC5883L-FDS
ITG3205

You can see a picture of the quadrotor below,

8480,What's the difference between feedback and feedforward control?,"I'm reading from Astrom & Murray (2008)'s Feedback Systems: An introduction for scientists and engineers about the difference between feedback and feedforward.  The book states:

Feedback is reactive: there must be an error before corrective actions are taken.  However, in some circumstances, it is possible to measure a disturbance before the disturbance has influenced the system.  The effect of the disturbance is thus reduced by measuring it and generating a control signal that counteracts it.  This way of controlling a system is called feedforward.

The passage makes it seem that feedback is reactive, while feedforward is not.  I argue that because feedforward control still uses sensor values to produce a control signal, it is still reactive to the conditions that the system finds itself in.  So, how can feedforward control possibly be any different from feedback if both are forms of reactive control?  What really separates the two from each other?
A illustrative example of the difference between the two would be very helpful.

Another suggestion we've received is to buy a computer power source, and modify it to output our the voltage and amperage we need. This raises some concerns, since our professor running the course might find this dangerous.

8487,Is there a way to disconnect and reconnect from a Create 2 that was streaming sensor readings without having to unplug/replug my USB-serial cable?,"I am working with a Create 2 and I am executing a simple sequence like (in pseudocode):

The outcome when I run the above program repeatedly is that it works the first time, I see sensor data (that seems to not change or be reactive) printing to the screen, but on future runs no serial can be read and the program crashes (because I am throwing an exception because I want to get this problem ironed out before getting to far along with other things). If I unplug and replug my USB cable from my Macbook, then the program will work for another run, and then fall back into the faulty behavior.
I do not experience this issue with other things like driving the robot, I am able to run programs of similar simplicity repeatedly. If I mix driving and sensor streaming, the driving works from program run to program run, but the data streaming crashes the program on the subsequent runs.
I have noticed that if I want to query a single sensor, I need to pause the stream to get the query response to come through on the serial port, and then resume it. That is why I am so inclined to pause/restart the stream.
Am I doing something wrong, like pausing the stream too often? Are there other things I need to take care of when starting/stopping the stream? Any help would be appreciated!
EDIT:
I should note that I am using Python and pyserial. I should also note, for future readers, that the iRobot pushes its streamed data to the laptop every 15ms where it sits in a buffer, and the data sits there until a call to serial.read() or to serial.flushInput(). This is why it seemed that my sensor values weren't updating when I read/polled every half second, because I was reading old values while the current ones were still buried at the back of the buffer. I worked around this issue by flushing the buffer and reading the next data to come in.
EDIT 2:
Sometimes the above workaround fails, so if I detect the failure, I pause the stream, re-initialize the stream, and read the fresh data coming in. This seems to work pretty well. It also seems to have solved the issue that I originally asked the question about. I still don't know exactly why it works, so I will still accept @Jonathan 's answer since I think it is good practice and has not introduced new issues, but has at least added the benefit of the robot letting me know that it has started/exited by sounding tones.

8491,Relative orientation of two robots,"Given two robot arms with TCP (Tool Center Point) coordinates in the world frame is:
$X_1 = [1, 1, 1, \pi/2, \pi/2, -\pi/2]$

$X_2 = [2, 1, 1, 0, -\pi/2, 0]$

$Base_{Rob1} = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$

(The coordinates are expressed as successive transformations, X-translation, Y-translation, Z-translation, X-rotation, Y-rotation, Z-rotation. None of the joint axes are capable or continuous rotations.)
How many degrees does the TCP of robot 2 have to rotate to have the same orientation as the TCP of robot one?
Is the calculation 
$\sqrt{(\pi/2 - 0)^2 + (\pi/2 - (-\pi/2))^2 + (-\pi/2 - 0)^2}$
wrong? If yes, please specify why.
UPDATED:
is the relative orientation of the two robots [/2,/2,/2][0,/2,0]=[/2,,/2]? but the euclidean distance cannot be applied to calculate angular distance?
In other words:

While programming the robot, and tool frame is selected for motion, to match the orientation of the other one, i would have to issue a move_rel($0, 0, 0, \pi/2, \pi, -\pi/2$) command, but the executed motion would have magnitude of $\pi$?

I'm working on making a walking robot with my arduino and 3d printing all the pieces I need. It will have four legs, but since it needs to be mobile, I didn't want the power supply to be huge. I've decided it would be best if I can get each leg to only require 1 servo, at 5V each. I know how to get the leg to move back and forth, but i want to be able to lift it in between; before it brings the leg forward, it needs to lift up the foot.
The only thing I can think of is the rotation maybe locking some sort of gear.
When a motor begins rotating clockwise, how can I have it power a short motion to move an object toward itself, and when it begins moving counterclockwise to power the same object a short distance away from itself?
The servos I am using have 180* of rotation, so they don't go all the way around in a loop.
also: don't know if it will be important or not, but because of the peculiar construction of the foot, it would be best if it was lifted straight up, rather than up at an angle, but it isn't 100% necessary. 
Are there any robots that already do this? if so, I'm unaware of them. Thanks for your time.

8511,What engineering problems needs to be solved to build a potato-peeling robot?,"OK, let's say we have a tech request for a robotic system for peeling potatoes, and a design is as follows:

One ""arm"" for picking up a potato and holding it, rotating when needed.
Another ""arm"" for holding a knife-like something which will peel the skin from the potato.
Arm picks up a potato from first container, holds it over trash bin while peeling, then puts peeled potato in second container.
For simplicity a human rinses peeled potatoes, no need to build automatic system for it.
In first iteration even 100% spherical peeled potatoes are OK, but ideally would be good to peel as little as possible, to minimize the wastes.

Question:
I know that we're very, very far away from building such a system. Nevertheless, what are the purely technical difficulties which needs to be solved for such a robot to be built? 
EDIT
Let's assume we stick to this design and not invent something radically different, like solving the problem with chemistry by dissolving the skin with something. I know that the problem of peeling the potatoes is currently being solved by other means - mainly by applying friction and a lot of water.
This question is not about it. I am asking specifically about the problems to be solved with the two-arms setup using the humanlike approach to peeling.

The trajectory I am planning is 2D, but this can be stripped down to 2 trajectories of 1 dimention each. There are no obstacles in the field, just bounds on the field itself (minimum and maximum values for x and y)

Total time needed (it should reach its destination at this specific
time) 
Starting and end position
Starting and end velocity
Starting and end acceleration
Maximum values for the position.

Ideally, I would also be able to specify the bounds for the velocity, acceleration, jerk and jounce, but I am comfortable with just generating the trajectory, and then checking if those values are exceeded.
Which algorithm can do that?
So far I have used fifth order polynomials, and checking for limits on velocity, acceleration, jerk and jounce afterwards, but I cannot set the maximum values for the position, and that is a problem...

Assuming Mapping is one process, Localization is another process, and some motion generating process called Exploration exist. Is it necessary to record all data as sequenced or with time stamps for coherence? 
There's Motion: $U_t$, Map: $M_t$, Estimated State: $X_t$, Measurement: $Z_t$
so..

each Estimated state, $X_t$, is a function of the current motion, $U_t$, current measurement, $Z_t$, and previous map, $M_{t-1}$;
each confidence weight, $w_t$, of estimated state is a function of current measurement, $Z_t$,  current estimate state, $X_t$, and previous map, $M_{t-1}$;
then each current map, $M_t$ is a function of current measurement, $Z_t$, current estimated state, $X_t$,  and previous map, $M_{t-1}$.

  Let $x= \theta$, $y=\frac{\mathrm{d} \theta}{\mathrm{d} t}$, $z=f$.
Solution with SOM:

three-dimensional surface in $(x,y,z)$
adapt two-dimensional SOM to surface
Method of control
  
  
For a given $(x,y)$ find neuron $k$ for wich $w_k = [w_{k1}, w_{k2}, w_{k2}, w_{k3}]$
$f(\theta)$ is then $w_{k3}$



I guess we use the SOM to learn the function $f$. However, I would like to understand where $f$ comes from / what it means in this model.

8636,sum_error in PID controller,"I'm trying to implement a PID controller by myself and I've a question about the sum_error in I control. Here is a short code based on the PID theory.

Now, I start my commands:
Phase 1, If at t=0, I set target=1.0, and the controller begins to drive motor to go to the target=1.0,
Phase 2, and then, at t=N, I set target=2.0, and the controller begins to drive motor to go to the target=2.0
My question is, in the beginning of phase 1, the error=1.0, the sum_error=0, and after the phase 1, the sum_error is not zero anymore, it's positive. And in the beginning of phase 2, the error=1.0 (it is also the same with above), but the sum_error is positive. So, the iTerm at t=N is much greater than iTerm at t=0.
It means, the curves between phase 2 and phase 1 are different!!!
But to end-user, the command 1, and the command 2 is almost the same, and it should drive the same effort.
Should I set the sum_error to zero or bound it? Can anyone tell me how to handle the sum_error in typical?
Any comment will be much appreciated!!

8642,Discontinuity in device orientation,"Why is there a discontinuity in the quaternion representation of my device orientation?
I'm using a SENtral+PNI RM3100+ST LSM330 to track orientation. I performed the following test:

Place the device in the center of a horizontal rotating plate (""lazy susan"").
Pause for a few seconds.
Rotate the plate 360 clockwise.
Pause for a few seconds.
Rotate the plate 360 clockwise again.

I got this output, which appears discontinuous at sample #1288-1289.

Sample #1288 has  , but sample #1289 has (Qx,Qy,Qz,Qw) = (0.7079, -0.6969, -0.0807, 0.0818).
Plugging in the formulas on page 32 of this document, this corresponds to a change in orientation from (Heading, Pitch, Roll) = (108, 0, 142) to (Heading, Pitch, Roll) = (-89, 0, 83).
The graph of (Heading, Pitch, Roll) is also not continuous mod 90.
Does this output make sense? I did not expect a discontinuity in the first plot, since the unit quaternions are a covering space of SO(3). Is there a hardware problem, or am I interpreting the data incorrectly?

8657,P gain tuning for quadcopter (Is my perception for a P-gain too high correct?),"Good day,
I am currently working on a project using Complementary filter for Sensor fusion and PID algorithm for motor control. I viewed a lot of videos in youtube as well as consulted various blogs and papers with what to expect with setting the P gain to high or too low.
P Gain too low

easy over correction and easy to turn by hand

P Gain too high

oscillates rapidly

I have a sample video of what I think a high P gain (3 in my case) looks like. Do this look like the P gain is too high?   
From the video:
I noticed that the quad sometimes corrects its orientation immediately after turning few degrees (4-5 deg). However, it does not do so in a consitent manner.
It also overcorrects.
The reason behind my doubt is because the quadcopter doesn't react immediately to changes. I checked the complementary filter. It updates (fast) the filtered angle reading from sudden angular acceleration from the gyro as well as updates the long term filtered angle changes from the accelerometer (albeit slowly). If I am right, is the the P gain is responsible for compensating the ""delay""?
The formula I used in the complementary filter is the following:

8661,Calculating required torques for a given trajectory using Lagrange-Euler,"I have a 2DOF robot with 2 revolute joints, as shown in the diagram below. I'm trying to calculate (using MATLAB) the torque required to move it but my answers don't match up with what I'm expecting.

Denavit-Hartenberg parameters:
$$
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
joint & a & \alpha & d & \theta \\
\hline
1 & 0 & \pi/2 & 0 & \theta_1 \\
2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \theta_2 \\
\end{array}
$$
I'm trying to calculate the torques required to produce a given acceleration, using the Euler-Lagrange techniques as described on pages 5/6 in this paper.
Particularly,
$$ T_i(inertial) = \sum_{j=0}^nD_{ij}\ddot q_i$$
where
$$ D_{ij} = \sum_{p=max(i,j)}^n Trace(U_{pj}J_pU_{pi}^T) $$
and
$$ 
J_i = \begin{bmatrix}
{(-I_{xx}+I_{yy}+I_{zz}) \over 2} & I_{xy} & I_{xz} & m_i\bar x_i \\
I_{xy} & {(I_{xx}-I_{yy}+I_{zz}) \over 2} & I_{yz} & m_i\bar y_i \\
I_{xz} & I_{yz} & {(I_{xx}+I_{yy}-I_{zz}) \over 2} & m_i\bar z_i \\
 m_i\bar x_i & m_i\bar y_i & m_i\bar z_i & m_i \end{bmatrix}
$$
As I was having trouble I've tried to create the simplest example that I'm still getting wrong. For this I'm attempting to calculate the inertial torque required to accelerate $\theta_1$ at a constant 1 ${rad\over s^2}$. As $\theta_2$ is constant at 0, I believe this should remove any gyroscopic/Coriolis forces. I've made link 1 weightless so its pseudo-inertia matrix is 0. I've calculated my pseudo-inertia matrix for link 2:
$$
I_{xx} = {mr^2 \over 2} = 0.0025\\ I_{yy} = I_{zz} = {ml^2 \over 3} = 2/3
$$
$$
J_2 =\begin{bmatrix}
1.3308 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
0 & 0.0025 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0.0025 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
My expected torque for joint 1:
$$ 
T_1 = I\ddot \omega \\
T_1 = {ml^2 \over 3} \times \ddot \omega \\
T_1 = {2\times1\over3}\times1 \\
T_1= {2\over3}Nm
$$
The torque calculated by my code for joint 1:

$$
T_1={4\over3}Nm
$$
So this is my problem, my code $T_1$ doesn't match up with my simple mechanics $T_1$.
The key functions called are shown below.
function inertial_torque_n = calc_inertial_torque(n, T, J, qdd)
    inertial_torque_n = 0;
    for j = 1:2
        Mnj = 0;
        joint_accel = qdd(j);
        for i = 1:2

            Ji = J(:,:,i);
            Uin = calcUij(T, i, n);
            Mnj = Mnj + trace(Uin*Ji*transpose(Uij));
        end
        inertial_torque_n = inertial_torque_n + Mnj * joint_accel;
    end
end

    T(:,:,j) = derivative(T(:,:,j));

    U = eye(4,4); 
    for x = 1:i
        U = U*T(:,:,x);
    end

Part of the course my robot will take includes a black line on a white background. At the end of the line there is a gap, and after the gap there is a semi circular line. There is a ball that the robot has to hit soon after the robot crosses the gap. 
The robot has a small code to follow the black line for a certain amount of time, enough time so that it stops just before the gap. The the robot just runs forward for 1 second across the gap, then the robot swings an arm to hit the ball, and after that I have the code for line-following again. However, once it crosses the gap, the robot stops in a different place every time, so the arm usually misses the ball. Is it possible to program the robot to hit the ball every time/almost every time in the GUI?

the robot arm i am using has a camera at the end of it, at which an object is being tracked. I can from the the camera frame retrieve a position, relative to that that frame but how do i convert that position in that frame, to an robot state, that set all the joint in a manner that  the camera keep the object at the center of the frame?...
-- My approach -- 
From my image analysis i retrieve a position of where the object i am tracking is positioned => (x,y) - coordinate.
I know at all the time the position (a) of the end tool by the T_base^tool - matrix, and from the image analysis i know the position (b) of the object relative to the camera frame for which i compute the difference as such c = b - a. 
I then compute the image jacobian, given the C, the distance to the object and the focal length of the camera. 
So... thats where i am at the moment.. I am not sure whether the position change retrieved from the cam frame will be seen as position of the tool point, at which  the equation will become un undetermined as the length of the state vector would become 7 instead of 6.  
The equation that i have must be 
$$J_{image}(q)dq = dp$$

J_image(q)[2x6]: being the image jacobian of the robot at current
state q 
dq[6x1]: wanted change in q-state 
dp[2x1]: computed positional change...

Solution would be found using linear least square..

8680,calculating position based on accelerometer data,"Please help me with the following task. I have MPU 9150 from which I get acceleration/gyro and magnetometer data. What I'm currently interested in is to get the orientation and position of the robot. I can get the position using quaternions. Its quite stable. Rarely changes when staying still.
But the problem is in converting accelerometer data to calculate the displacement.
As I know its required to to integrate twice the accel. data to get position.
Using quaternion I can rotate the vector of acceleration and then sum it's axises to get velocity then do the same again to get position. But it doesn't work that way. First of all moving the sensor to some position and then moving it back doesn't give me the same position as before. The problem is that after I put the sensor back and it stays without any movement the velocity doesn't change to zero though the acceleration data coming from sensors are zeros.
Here is an example (initially its like this):
the gravity: -0.10  -0.00   1.00
raw accel: -785 -28 8135
accel after scaling to +-g: -0.10   -0.00   0.99
the result after rotating accel vector using quaternion: 0.00   -0.00   -0.00
After moving the sensor and putting it back it's acceleration becomes as:
 0.00   -0.00   -0.01
 0.00   -0.00   -0.01
 0.00   -0.00   -0.00
 0.00   -0.00   -0.01
and so on.
If I'm integrating it then I get slowly increasing position of Z.
But the worst problem is that the velocity doesn't come back to zero
For example if I move sensor once and put it back the velocity will be at:
-0.089 for vx and
0.15 for vy
After several such movements it becomes:
-1.22 for vx
1.08 for vy 
-8.63 for vz
and after another such movement:
vx -1.43
vy 1.23
vz -9.7
The x and y doesnt change if sensor is not moving but Z is changing slowly.
Though the quaternion is not changing at all.
What should be the correct way to do that task?

Assume that the total weight of the quad is ~1.1Kg and I would like to have payload upto 400g, making the quad weigh ~1.5Kg

From all that I've learnt, the Thrust:Weight ratio should never fall below 1.7:1 (and a 2:1 is recommended to have better control) which if does creates problems in lifting my quad vertically smoothly. I'm neither planning to have very high maneuverability nor cruise the sky pushing my quad's limits. I just want it to fly.

Here's the motors pull(g)-amps(A)-voltage(V)-power(W)-specificThrust(g/W) information for A2212 1400kv with 10 x 4.5 Props


Since my battery's discharge rate is limited to 20C, if I'm not wrong, it can give out only 60A (since its 3000mAh) for the entire circuit with four motors, each of which can take 15A max, which from the above table would produce ~600g thrust, which is 2400g from all four motors.

Does this mean I can get 1.6:1 Thrust:Weight at 100% throttle? Can my quad still take off vertically smoothly?

I'm also confused about the efficacy of my motor, meaning if I buy a bigger motor, can get more than 600g thrust at 15A/11.1V with same/bigger props? If not, is this the most efficient combination of motor and prop?

I'm doing a project based on AndroCopter and its clearly mentioned that it specifically requires the use of PPM controlled ESCs.

Can I use any ESCs available in the market for this project?

It's also mentioned in the Github repo that PPM controlled ESCs are the most common ones. However from some who explained ESCs in Youtube video has commented back for my doubt telling that most common ESCs are PWM controlled which is contradicting the previous statement.
PS: I need to use Arduino Mega to control the four ESCs. And Arduino Mega is programmed to send out PPM signals which is exactly why I need PPM controlled ESCs. Correct me if I made any mistakes.

There is a 3A battery holder and when I connect robot to that and put it on the ground both the motors working fine and smooth. But when I connect the L298N motor controller which was made by myself and tested with proteus, only one motor is working. When I switch the wires of both motors, still the motor which worked before is working and the other motor never runs unless I manually give a little rotation to the wheel.
I use a PIC18F4431 to control the motor controller and tried USB power and a 5V regulator created by myself and the result is the same in both occasions. What could be the issue here? If I tried oiling the malfunctioning motor will it work? I heard one of my friends having the same issue, one motor is not working. But both motors work with just two pen torch batteries and can't think of a valid reason that the motor is faulty. May be my motor controller? But when I swap the wires from faulty to the working one, the working one still works as I've mentioned above.

8710,ROS on Raspberry Pi Model 2: UbuntuARM vs ROSBerryPi,"Before I ask my question, I'd better confirm that I've read the most prominent post about running ROS on Raspberry Pi devices.
That post contains some valuable information, but it's a bit dated, and ROS support for ARM devices is much better these days. In fact, ROS 2.0 is evidently going to have excellent support for running on embedded devices like the Raspberry Pi.
I just got a Pi model 2 for my birthday, and I'm really eager to get ROS running on it so I can build a robot I've been working on, which is based on the Wild Thumper 6WD platform.
From my perspective, here are a few pros & cons regarding UbuntuARM and ROSBerryPi:
UbuntuARM
Pros:

Ubuntu is the official ROS distro and is the most well-supported ROS OS 
The best documentation on the ROS wiki for running on ARM devices is written for UbuntuARM

Cons:

Raspbian (on which ROSBerryPi is based) is the official distro for Rasbperry Pi and thus has the best support for the board.


ROSBerryPi
Pros:

Raspbian (on which ROSBerryPi is based) is the official distro for Rasbperry Pi and thus has the best support for the board.
Cons:
ROS is not well supported on OS's other than Ubuntu
To use the ROSBerryPi distro, you must build ROS from source.

My question is: can anyone provide any further insight into this dilemma? If you've been running ROS on your Raspberry Pi 2 (model 2 only please; the model B+ has completely different issues, like not being well-supported by Ubuntu), what's your experience been? 
Which distro would/did you choose, and why?

8732,Weird magnetometer values,"I bought a 3-axis magnetometer (Similar to this one ) And plugged into an Arduino in order to read the heading value.
I mounted it on my robot and I drove with the robot for around 30 meters, turned 180 degrees and drove back to my starting position. I plotted the heading value and it shows inconsistent values. The 180 degrees turn started at sec 55, the rest is driving in one direction using a joystick and following a wall as reference so small deviations are expected but not that big as in the image.

When the robot is turning in-place, there is no such problem and the heading variation follows the rotation of the robot. The robot (Turtlebot) is a little bit shaky such that the magnetometer doesn't always have the x and y axes parallel to the floor but I don't think few degrees of offset can cause such a huge difference. I calculate the heading as follows:

heading = atan2(y field intensity, x field intensity)

Why does this happen? Could it be form some metals or electric wires under the floor?
Can you suggest a more robust method/sensor for estimating the heading in indoor environments?

8751,How do I go about implementing a Kalman Filter for a pose estimation algorithm?,"I am currently in the process of writing a pose estimation algorithm using image data. I receive images at 30 fps, and for every image, my program computes the x,y,z and roll, pitch, yaw of the camera with respect to a certain origin. This is by no means very accurate, there are obvious problems such as too much exposure in the image, not enough feature points in the image, etc., and the positions go haywire every once in a while; so I want to write a Kalman filter that can take care of this part.  
I have read through the basics of KF, EKF etc. and then I was reading through an OpenCV tutorial that has an implementation of a Kalman Filter inside an algorithm for the pose estimation of an object. While this matches my use case very well, I don't understand why they are using a linear Kalman Filter while explicitly specifying parameters like (dt*dt) in the state transition matrix. For reference, the state transition matrix they are considering is 

I'm a little confused, so my main question can be broken down into three parts:

Would a linear Kalman Filter suffice for a 6DOF pose estimation filtering? Or should I go for an EKF?
How do I come up with the ""model"" of the system? The camera is not really obeying any trajectory, the whole point of the pose estimation is to track the position and rotation even through noisy movements. I don't understand how they came up with that matrix.
Can the Kalman Filter understand that, for instance, if the pose estimation says my camera has moved half a meter between one frame and other, that's plain wrong, because at 1/30th of a second, there's no way that could happen?

Thank you!

Maximum velocity is 5 m/s. 
Requirments about sensors: it's possible to place any sensor on the surface, but it's impossible to change the construction. So it's impossible to use encoders at the rotation axis to measure the angle.

An updated question may be: Is precise satellite positioning accurate enough to guide/navigate a full-scale passenger car in an obstacle-free outdoor environment in the speed of about 100 km/h given I have a precise-enough path prerecorded that is to follow?
Some answers below already say yes, this is a solved problem. It would be nice to have the answers elaborated in more detail regarding the existing solutions (accuracy, possible problems etc.). One of the solutions may probably be the open source APM autopilot which work for rovers too (example by Emlid) but that does not seem to use RTK so the accuracy may be rather low.

8844,DC Motor to open a door,"I want to open a door using a DC motor. I've estimated that the required power in the worst case would be around 35-40W (considering a ~80% efficiency). The whole is controlled by a Particle Photon.
I was thinking to use a L298N to control the output of current to the motor. However, when I looked for powerful enough motors, they would all consume too much current when stalling (> 4A part of the L298N datasheet).
Do you have ideas of how to overcome this? Maybe there's another dual-bridge that can handle more current, maybe there exists a DC motor that is ok for a L298N, or maybe I need to have simultaneous DC motors?
Edit: this part should be a question by itself. I'll keep it here so that future visitors know what the sub-question was about, but please ignore it from now on if answering.

As a sub-question, would it be better to use a brushed or a brushless DC motor?

8849,Tracking objects from camera; PID controlling; Parrot AR Drone 2,"I am working on a project where I should perform object tracking using the camera of Parrot AR Drone 2.0. So the main idea is, a drone should be able to identify a specified colour and then follow it by keeping some distance.
I am using the cvdrone API to establish communication with the drone. This API provides function:

which moves the AR.Drone in 3D space and where 

vx: X velocity [m/s]
vy: Y velocity [m/s]
vz: Z velocity [m/s]
vr: Rotational speed [rad/s]

I have written an application which does simple image processing on the images obtained from the camera of the drone using OpenCV and finds needed contours of the object to be tracked. See the example below:

Now the part I am struggling is finding the technique using which I should find the velocities to be sent to the move3D function. I have read that common way of doing controlling is by using PID controlling. However, I have read about that and could not get how it could be related to this problem.
To summarise, my question is how to move a robot towards an object detected in its camera? How to find coordinates of certain objects from the camera?

8852,Quadcopter Charging,"Our thesis is about Multicopter using two batteries wherein the first battery is used and when the power goes out, a switch is placed use to charge the first battery while the second battery is powering the multicopter, the process repeats again and again until all the power of the battery is drained. Is the process possible to achieved?
Edit 1:
Just to clear everything up again. The thesis is about a Quadcopter that uses two batteries as its power source. These two batteries are attached to a ""switching circuit system"" that will allow one battery to be drained then the quadcopter will be transferred to the other battery. The solar panels serve as the ""charger"" of whatever battery is in its standby mode (the discharged battery). So while one battery is being used by the quadcopter, one will be connected to a solar panel which will be charging that battery. Once the other battery is drained, the quadcopter will switch to the charged battery. This will continue to go on until both batteries are drained. Is this achievable?

Ideally, I would be able to know how much weight each leg is supporting, so that I could both balance the weight and adapt to moving (up or down) terrain (so, if you put a finger below one leg and lifted it, the leg would go up); however, if that's not possible, a simple binary signal would do.

For the gyro Ive found following values in the datasheet:
Total RMS Noise = 0.05 /s
Low-frequency RMS noise = 0.033 /s 
Rate Noise Spectral Density = 0.005 /s/sqrt(Hz)
Now I want to ask how I can calculate these values from my dataset?

Angular Random Walk (ARW) = 0.003 /sqrt(s) (From Allan deviation plot)

Is the ARW equal to the Rate Noise Spectral Density mentioned in the datasheet? And also is the RMS Noise from the datasheet equal to the standard deviation?

When this mobile robot operates, the rack (which is said to weight up to 450 kg) can have its Center Of Mass (COM) distributed at any location. For example, this COM can be located 5 or 10 cm off from the center of the robot. Because of this, when the robot revolves, the center of rotation will not be at the center of the robot anymore. However as you see in the video, it can still rotate many circles perfectly around its up-right axis.
So what do you think about this? Is this possible by mechanical design only? Or did they use some kind of advanced feedback control system to counter the effect of the off-center COM?

8895,Quadcopter PID Control: Is it possible to stabilize a quadcopter considering only angle measurements?,"Good day,
I am a student currently working on an autonomous quadcopter project, specifically the stabilization part as of now. I am using a tuned propeller system and I also already considered the balancing of the quadcopter during component placements. I had been tuning the PID's of my quadcopter for the past 3 1/2 weeks now and the best I've achieved is a constant angle oscillation of the quadcopter by +-10 degrees with 0 degrees as the setpoint/desired angle. I also tried a conservative 7 degrees setpoint with the same results on the pitch axis.
As of now my PID code takes in the difference of the angle measurement from the complementary filter  and the desired angle.

I have read somewhere that it is IMPOSSIBLE to stabilize the quadcopter utilizing only angle measurements, adding that the angular rate must be also taken into consideration. But I have read a lot of works using only a single pid loop with angle differences (Pitch Yaw and Roll) as the input. 
In contrast to what was stated above, I have read a comment from this article () by Edouard Leurent that a Single PID control loop only angle errors and a Cascaded PID loop (Angle and Rate) that utilizes both angle errors and angular velocity errors are equivalent Mathematically.
If I were to continue using only the Single PID loop (Angle) method, I would only have to tune 3 parameters (Kp, Ki & Kd).
But if I were to change my code to utilize the Cascaded Loop (Angle and Angular Velocity),

Would I have to tune two sets of the 3 parameters (Kp, Ki & Kd for angle and Kp, Ki & Kd for the angular velocity)?
Would the cascaded PID control loop give better performance than the single PID control loop?
In the Cascaded Loop, is the set point for the angular velocity for stabilized flight also 0 in deg/sec? What if the quadcopter is not yet at its desired angle?

Thank you :)

8900,SLAM : Why is marginalization the same as schur's complement?,"Consider the system 
$$
\tag 1
H\delta x=-g
$$
 where $H$ and $g$ are the Hessian and gradient of some cost function $f$ of the form $f(x)=e(x)^Te(x)$. The function $e(x)=z-\hat{z}(x)$ is an error function, $z$ is an observation (measurement) and  $\hat{z}$ maps the estimated parameters to a measurement prediction. 
This minimization is encountered in each iteration of many SLAM algorithms, e.g.one could think of $H$ as a bundle adjustment Hessian. Suppose $x=(x_1,x_2)^T$, and let $x_2$ be some variables that we seek to marginalize. Many authors claim that this marginalization is equivalent to solving a smaller liner system $M\delta x_1=-b$ where $M$ and $g$ are computed by applying Schur's complement to (1), i.e. if
$$H=
\begin{pmatrix}
H_{11} & H_{12}\\
H_{21} & H_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
then
$$
M=H_{11}-H_{12}H_{22}^{-1}H_{21}
$$ 
and 
$$
b=g_1-H_{12}H_{22}^{-1}g_2
$$
I fail to understand why that is equivalent to marginalization... I understand the concept of marginalization for a Gaussian, and I know that schur's complement appears in the marginalization if we use the canonical representation (using an information matrix), but I don't see the link with the linear system. 
Edit: I understand how Schur's complement appears in the process of marginalizing or conditioning $p(a,b)$ with $a,b$ Gaussian variables, as in the link supplied by Josh Vander Hook. I had come to the same conclusions, but using the canonical notation: If we express the Gaussian $p(a,b)$ in canonical form, then $p(a)$ is gaussian and its information matrix is the Schur complement of the information matrix of $p(a,b)$, etc. Now the problem is that I don't understand how Schur's complement appears in marginalization in bundle adjustment (for reference, in these recent papers: c-klam (page 3 if you want to look) and in this (part titled marginalization). In these papers, a single bundle adjustment (BA) iteration is performed in a manner similar to what I initially described in the question. I feel like there is a simple connection between marginalizing a Gaussian and the marginalization in BA that I am missing. For example, one could say that optimizing $f$ (one iteration) is equivalent to drawing a random variable following a denstiy $$e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)}$$  where $\Sigma$ is the inverse of the Hessian $H$ of $f$, and $\mu$ is the true value for $x$ (or an approximation of that value), and that marginalizing this density is equivalent to using Schur's compelement in the bundle? I am really confused...

But when I digitalRead the pin, then there is only one change.  
I also noticed that the interrupt is also triggered when going from HIGH to LOW.
Here is an example of the ouput I have:
0__0
0__0
0__0
0__0
...
...
0__0
0__0
0__0   <<< change from LOW to HIGH... 
1__9   <<< the interrupt must have incremented only once... 9 instead !
1__9
1__9
1__9
...
...
1__9
1__9   <<< change from HIGH to LOW. the interrupt shouldn't be triggered
0__24  <<< still... we have 15 increments
0__24
0__24
0__24
0__24
...
...
0__24
0__24   <<< same here...
1__51   <<< 26 increments
1__51
...
...
1__51  <<< same here...
0__67  <<< 16 increments
0__67
0__67

The only way I can explain that is that during a change of state, the signal received from the sensor is not really square, but somehow noisy.
Like in this image :

Therefore we would have, indeed, many RISING on one change....
(However reading the output of the sensor on an analog pin shows a direct variation from 880(HIGH) to 22(LOW))
Does anyone have another explanation? Or a solution to this problem ?

8951,Establishing Data Transfer between two Raspberry Pi's using GPIO,"Good day
I am currently implementing an autonomous quadcopter with stereo vision using raspberry Pi. One (Let's call this Pi_1) is responsible for stereo vision the other is responsible for motor control and trajectory planning (Pi_2). I was looking for a way to transfer a 480 element float vector via GPIO from Pi_1 to Pi_2. Pi_1 stereovision program runs at 2Hz while Pi_2 motor control runs at 210Hz. 

Is there any protocol fast enough to deliver this amount of information to the second raspberry pi via GPIO? 

I am currently looking at SPI but I saw that the Raspberry Pi cannot be turned to a Slave making it not an option. I also looked at UART however it is too slow for my needs. All the I2c ports on the Pi are currently being used by the stereo vision cameras and the IMU's. If the gpio option is not feasible, I am also open for other suggestions such as using other hardware (middle man) or wireless options.

8973,How to estimate the position of multiple static ground targets captured from a down facing camera?,"An aerial vehicle captures images of the ground using its down facing camera. From the images, multiple targets are converted from their pixel position to the camera reference frame using the pinhole camera model. Since the targets are static and there is information of the vehicle attitude and orientation, each sample is then converted to the world referencial frame. Note that all targets are on a flat, level plane.
The vehicle keeps ""scanning"" for the targets and converting them to the world referencial frame. Due to the quality of the camera and detection algorithm, as well as errors on the altitude information, the position of the ""scanned"" targets is not constant (not accurate). A good representation might be a gaussian distribution around the target true position, however it will also be influenced by the movement of the aerial vehicle.
What's the best approach to estimate the position of the targets from multiple readings?
This basically resumes to a problem of noise removal (as well as outlier removal) and estimation, so I would like to know what algorithms and strategies could solve the problem. In the end I expect to implement and test a collection of different approachs to understand their performance on this specific problem.
Furthermore, this system is implemented using ROS, so if you know of packages that already do what I'm searching for I would be glad to hear. You can also cite papers on the topic that you think might be of my interest.

I am currently implementing a single loop PID controller using angle setpoints as inputs. I was trying out a different approach for the D part of the PID controller. 
What bought this about is that when I was able to reach a 200Hz (0.00419ms) loop rate, when adding a D gain, the quadcopter seems to dampen the movements in a non continous manner. This was not the case when my algorithm was running at around 10Hz. At an angle set point of 0 degrees, I would try to push it to one side by 5 degrees then the quad would try to stay rock solid by resisting the movements but lets go after while enabling me to get it of by 2 degrees (the dampening effect weakens over time) then tries to dampen the motion again.
This is my implementation of the traditional PID:

Derivative on Error:


What I tried to do now is to implement a derivative on measurement method from this article to remove derivative output spikes. However the Derivative part seems to increase the corrective force than dampen it.

Derivative on Measurement:

//Calculate Orientation Error (current - target)
float pitchError = pitchAngleCF - pitchTarget;
pitchErrorSum += (pitchError*deltaTime2);
float pitchErrorDiff = pitchAngleCF - pitchPrevAngleCF; // <----
pitchPrevAngleCF = pitchAngleCF;

float rollError = rollAngleCF - rollTarget;
rollErrorSum += (rollError*deltaTime2);
float rollErrorDiff = rollAngleCF - rollPrevAngleCF; // <----
rollPrevAngleCF = rollAngleCF;

float yawError = yawAngleCF - yawTarget;
yawErrorSum += (yawError*deltaTime2);
float yawErrorDiff = yawAngleCF - yawPrevAngleCF; // <----
yawPrevAngleCF = yawAngleCF;


//PID controller list // <---- The D terms are now negative
float pitchPID = pitchKp*pitchError + pitchKi*pitchErrorSum - pitchKd*pitchErrorDiff/deltaTime2;
float rollPID = rollKp*rollError + rollKi*rollErrorSum - rollKd*rollErrorDiff/deltaTime2;
float yawPID = yawKp*yawError + yawKi*yawErrorSum - yawKd*yawErrorDiff/deltaTime2;

If I take off the robot's lid (and thus the lens protector) the localization solution becomes erratic and inaccurate, so I think the lens protector might be changing the distortion properties significantly.
Today the lens protector became detached and it was replaced shortly after. So now the calibration may no longer be valid and the localization solution is much more noisy.

9013,How many DOFs required to define a 3D pose,"I understand that to be able to define point in 3D space, you need three degrees of freedom (DOFs). To additionally define an orientation in 3D space, you need 6 DOFs. This is intuitive to me when each of these DOFs defines the position or orientation along one axis or an orthogonal X-Y-Z system.
However, consider a robot arm such as this: . This too has 6 DOFs, but rather than each DOF defining a position or orientation in an X-Y-Z system, it defines an angular rotation of one joint along the arm. If all the joints were arranged along a single axis, for example, then these 6 DOFs would in fact only define one angular rotation.
So, it is not true that each DOF independently defines a single position or orientation. However, in the case of this robot arm, it can reach most positions and orientations. I'm assuming this is because the geometry of the links between the joints make each DOF define an independent position or orientation, but that is a very vague concept to me and not as intuitive as simply having one DOF per position or orientation.
Can somebody offer some help in understanding these concepts?

I want to measure the inclination of the sensor along the scan and ensure that it does not change. The problem I have found is that the measured magnetic field from the integrated magnetometer varies greatly with position along the pipe, and in turn, causes a large, position dependent error in one axis of the inclination reported by the iNEMO IMU. In fig. 1 below I show the set up of the test, I measured the inclination from the IMU while moving it along the length of the pipe and back again. The board did not change inclination throughout the measurement. In Fig 2 I show the magnetometer and inclination measurements recorded by the ""iNEMO application"" showing the large error in one of the inclinations.
My question is whether you know if there is any way of correcting for the magnetic field variation so that I can still accurately determine the inclination in all three directions? My data suggests to me that the magnetic field variation measured from the magnetometer is much greater than the geomagnetic field, so the inclination measurement will always be inaccurate.

9027,Do walking robots use accelerometers?,"My understanding of walking robots (e.g. ) is that they use a gyroscope to determine the current orientation of the robot, or each joint of the robot. This is because if you just put encoders on each joint, the cumulative error over the entire robot will be too large to maintain stability. Therefore, a gyroscope measures the ""real"" orientation, and this is used for feedback when the robot is walking.
However, I'm also aware that some walking robots use accelerometers to maintain stability. What would be the benefit of using an accelerometer in this case? Would it be used instead of a gyroscope, or together with a gyroscope?
My guess is that gyroscopes do not measure acceleration directly (unless you were to numerically calculate this based on lots of orientation readings), but accelerometers do measure it directly (and more reliably than this numerical method). Know the acceleration as well as the position then enables to robot to more accurately predict its future position, and hence the feedback loop is more robust. Is this correct, or am I missing the point?

9043,Joystick Rate Limit Filter For FRC Java Programming,"I am a programmer for my school's FRC robotics team and have received the request from our hardware/driving department to limit the speed at which the robot's motors can accelerate given a joystick input telling it to increase the speed of the motor. For example, when the robot first starts up and the driver decides to move the joystick from the center to the fully up position (0 to full motor power), we don't want it to literally go from 0 to full motor power in an instant - it obviously creates some rather jerky, unstable behavior. How might I receive the target joystick position from the joystick, save it, and build up to it over time (and if any other inputs are sent in this process  like telling it to turn around  stop the current process and enact the new one)?
I am using Java with WPILib's 2016 robotics library: here's the API , and here's the tutorials .
I am using the ""IterativeRobot"" template class, and teleop is being run in the method teleopPeriodic(), which is continuously called every few milliseconds in the program (it's where i'm receiving joystick input and calling the method RobotDrive.tankDrive() with the inputs).
I realize this is more of a programming question than a robotics question, but I figured it would be better to put it here than in stack overflow, etc. If someone could give me some simple pseudocode or just a conceptual idea of how this might be done (not necessarily as it pertains directly to the library or the language I'm using), that would be great.

9044,Create 2 Cable with 700 Series Roomba,"For the last few months I have been playing with ROS on an nVidia Jetson TK1 development board. Up until this point, it has mostly been playing with the GPIO header, an Arduino Uno, a couple physical contact sensors, and a few custom motor and servo boards that I slapped together. But lately I've been eyeing an old 700 series Roomba that has been gathering dust (was replaced by an 800 series).
Does anyone know if the Communication Cable for Create 2 will work with a 700 series Roomba?
I know there are DIY designs out there, but I have always been a fan of using off-the-shelf components if they exist - you rarely save more money than your time is worth if it is something like a cable or similar component. So if the Create 2 cable will work, I'll use that. If not, I'll see what I can do to make my own.

9048,L293D won't turn motor backwards,"My small robot has two motors controlled by an L293D and that is controlled via a Raspberry Pi. They will both go forwards but only one will go backwards. 
I've tried different motors and tried different sockets in the breadboard, no luck. Either the L293D's chip is broken (but then it wouldn't go forwards) or I've wired it wrong. 
I followed the tutorial, Controlling DC Motors Using Python With a Raspberry Pi, exactly.
Here is a run down of what works. Let the 2 motors be A and B:
When I use a python script (see end of post) both motors go ""forwards"". When I change the values in the Python script, so the pin set to HIGH and the pin set to LOW are swapped, motor A will go ""backwards"", this is expected. However, motor B will not move at all. 
If I then swap both motors' wiring then the original python script will make both go backwards but swapping the pins in the code will make motor A go forwards but motor B won't move.
So basically, motor A will go forwards or backwards depending on the python code but motor B can only be changed by physically changing the wires.

Right now the robots only have:

No initial knowledge of the house or their location (no docks, no mappings/markings, nada) 
Can communicate via wifi and that part is open ended

I'm hoping to be able to stitch the scanned rooms together before the robots even meet. Compass + altimeter + gps will get me close but the goal is to be within an inch of accuracy which makes this tough. There IS freedom to add whatever parts to the robots themselves / laptop but the home needs to stay dynamic (robots will be in a different home every time).

9074,Software real-time of ROS system,"As far as I know, a hardware real-time robot control system requires a specific computing unit to solve the kinematics and dynamics of a robot such as interval zero RTX, which assigns CPU cores exclusively for the calculation, or a DSP board, which does exactly the same calculation. This configuration makes sure that each calculation is strictly within, maybe, 1 ms. 
My understanding is that ROS, which runs under Ubuntu, doesn't have a exclusive 
computing unit for that. Kinematics and dynamics run under different threads of the same CPU which operates the Ubuntu system, path plan, and everything else. 
My question is that how does ROS achieve software-real time? Does it slow down the sampling time to maybe 100ms and makes sure each calculation can be done in time? Or the sampling time changes at each cycle maybe from 5ms, 18ms, to 39ms each time in order to be as fast as possible and ROS somehow compensates for it at each cycle?

9077,PID Tuning for an Unbalanced Quadcopter: When do I know if the I-gain I've set is too high?,"Good day,
I am working on an autonomous flight controller for a quadcopter ('X' configuration) using only angles as inputs for the setpoints used in a single loop PID controller running at 200Hz (PID Implementation is Here: Quadcopter PID Controller: Derivative on Measurement / Removing the Derivative Kick). For now I am trying to get the quadcopter to stabilize at a setpoint of 0 degrees. The best I was able to come up with currently is +-5 degrees which is bad for position hold. I first tried using only a PD controller but since the quadcopter is inherently front heavy due to the stereo cameras, no amount of D or P gain is enough to stabilize the system. An example is the image below which I added a very small I gain:

As you can see from the image above (at the second plot), the oscillations occur at a level below zero degrees due to the quadcopter being front heavy. This means that the quad oscillates from the level postion of 0 degrees to and from a negative angle/towards the front. To compensate for this behaviour, I discovered that I can set the DC level at which this oscillations occur using the I gain to reach the setpoint. An image is shown below with [I think] an adequate I gain applied:

I have adjusted the PID gains to reduce the jitters caused by too much P gain and D gain. These are my current settings (Which are two tests with the corresponding footage below):

Test 1: 
Test 2: 
I can't seem to tune the quadcopter to reach the setpoint with at least +-1 degrees of error. I noticed that further increasing the I-gain no longer increases the DC offset. 

When do I know if the I-gain I've set is too high? How does it reflect on the plot?

EDIT:
The Perr in the graphs are just the difference of the setpoint and the CF (Complementary Filter) angle.
The Derr plotted is not yet divided by the deltaTime because the execution time is small ~ 0.0047s which will make the other errors P and I hard to see.
The Ierr plotted is the error integrated with time.
All the errors plotted (Perr, Ierr, Derr) are not yet multiplied by the Kp, Ki, and Kd constants
The 3rd plot for each of the images is the response of the quadcopter. The values on the Y axis correspond to the value placed as the input into the gpioPWM() function of the pigpio library. I had mapped using a scope the values such that 113 to 209 pigpio integer input corresponds to 1020 to 2000ms time high of the PWM at 400Hz to the ESC's

So I am going to draw the curve with a marker or a pen.

Yes to do this project I need motors which would change the position of a marker but which one?

I would make my marker holder movable with help of rack and pinion mechanism but I am not sure that this would be precise and I may have to alter to some other mechanism and if you know such then that can really help me.
b. A cylindrical one 
Here I would roll a paper on this cylinder and this paper will get unrolled as the cylinder rotates and even the marker holder is movable but only in X direction and the rolling of paper is nothing but change of Y position.

Which one of the above two methods is good?
I know about microcontrollers and I want to control the motors using them so I decided to go with Atmega 16 microcontroller. But here i might need microstepping of signals how would I be able to do that with microcontrollers?

1.Does it make sense to use the odometry data(v_linear, omega) in both the prediction as well as update steps?
2.How do I account for the frequency difference between the odometry data(10Hz) and the imu data(40Hz)? Do I run the filter at the lower frequency, do I dynamically change the matrix sizes or is there any other way?

The variable terrain could potentially knock the robot off of its initial heading, but I would like to design an autonomous sequence to correct for any change in direction. I am using a very accurate sensor with compass and yaw. What is the best way to have it correct for any changes and maintain its heading? Side to side motion does not have to stay perfect, but the heading needs to stay the same.We are currently correcting it by overpowering one side of the wheels (depending on direction of correction needed) until the heading is correct again, but this seems to be a slightly antiquated method, so I'm looking for a cleaner and more smooth method.

9169,PID Control: Integral error does not converge to zero,"Good day,
I had been recently reading up more on PID controllers and stumbled upon something called integral wind up. I am currently working on an autonomous quadcopter concentrating at the moment on PID tuning. I noticed that even with the setpoint of zero degrees reached in this video, the quadcopter would still occasionally overshoot a bit:  
Here is the corresponding data testing the roll axis:

I noticed that the I-error does not converge to zero and continues to increase:


Is this the integral wind-up?
What is the most effective way to resolve this?

I have seen many implementations mainly focusing on limiting the output of the system by means of saturation. However I do not see this bringing the integral error eventually back to zero once the system is stable.
Here is my current code implementation with the setpoint of 0 degrees:

9180,How does information gain based exploration differ from frontier based?,"I've recently come across the concept of using information gain (or mutual information criteria) as a metric for minimizing entropy on a map to aid in robotic exploration. I have somewhat of a basic question about it. 
A lot of papers that talk about minimizing entropy consider an example case of something like a laser scanner and try to compute the 'next best pose' so that the maximum entropy reduction is achieved. Usually this is mentioned like ""information gain based approaches help finding the best spot to move the robot such that the most entropy is minimized using raycasting techniques, as opposed to frontier based exploration which is greedy"" etc. But I don't understand what the underlying reason is for information gain/entropy based exploration being better. 
Let's say a robot in a room with three walls and open space in front. Because of range limitations, it can only see two walls: so in frontier based exploration, the robot has two choices; move towards the third wall and realize it's an obstacle, or move towards the open space and keep going. How does an information gain based method magically pick the open space frontier over the wall frontier? When we have no idea what's beyond our frontiers, how can raycasting even help?

In my case, I've done the theoretical and practical parts of controlling nonlinear model of a simple pendulum plus other manipulators problems in C++. For the pendulum, I've utilized a backstepping controller for solving the tracking task for the angular displacement and velocity. The results are 
$$

I have already been able to calculate the polar histogram, as described in the paper, as well as the smoothing function to eliminate noise. This variable is stored in a numpy array, named .
However, the function computeTheta, pasted below, which computes the steering direction, is only able to compute the proper direction if the valleys (i.e. consecutive sectors in the polar histogram whose obstacle density is below a certain threshold) do not contain the section where a full circle is completed, i.e. the sector corresponding to 360.
To make things clearer, consider these two examples: 

If the histogram contains a peak in the angles between, say, 330 and 30, with the rest of the histogram being a valley, then the steering direction will be computed correctly.
If, however, the peak is contained between, say, 30 and 60, then the valley will start at 60, go all the way past 360 and end in 30, and the steering direction will be computed incorrectly, since this single valley will be considered two valleys, one between 0 and 30, and another between 60 and 360.

9232,How to interrupt on a data ready trigger when communications to the sensor are interrupt driven?,"Background: I'm using the L3GD20H MEMS gyroscope with an Arduino through a library (Pololu L3G) that in turn relies on interrupt-driven I2C (Wire.h); I'd like to be able to handle each new reading from the sensor to update the calculated angle in the background using the data ready line (DRDY). Currently, I poll the STATUS register's ZYXDA bit (which is what the DRDY line outputs) as needed.
General question: With some digital output sensors (I2C, SPI, etc.), their datasheets and application notes describe using a separate (out-of-band) hardware line to interrupt the microcontroller and have it handle new sets of data. But on many microcontrollers, retrieving data (let alone clearing the flag raising the interrupt line) requires using the normally interrupt-driven I2C subsystem of a microcontroller. How can new sensor data be retrieved from the ISR for the interrupt line when also using the I2C subsystem in an interrupt-driven manner?
Possible workarounds:

Use nested interrupts (as @hauptmech mentioned): re-enable I2C interrupt inside of ISR. Isn't this approach discouraged?
Use non-interrupt-driven I2C (polling)--supposedly a dangerous approach inside of ISRs. The sensor library used depends on the interrupt-driven Wire library.
[Edit: professors' suggestion] Use a timer to interrupt set to the sample rate of the sensor (which is settable and constant, although we measure it to be e.g. 183.3Hz rather than 189.4Hz per the datasheet). Handling the I2C transaction still requires re-enabling interrupts, i.e. nested interrupts or performing I2C reads from the main program.

[Edit:] Here's a comment I found elsewhere on a similar issue that led me to believe that the hang encountered was from I2C reads failing inside an interrupt handler:  

during the ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) I was trying to read the
  device to determine which bit changed. Bad idea, this chip uses the
  I2C communications which require interrupts, but interrupts are turned
  off during an ISR and everything goes kinda south.

I am building a kind of 'demo-bot' for some students I will be teaching; it will use both the demo files and some of my own code. Now, after setting things up, I try to run the talker tutorial just to check to make sure that everything is running, and rospack is pretty sure that the tutorials don't exist.

This is the case for every tutorial file; python and C++. Now, I am sure the tutorials are installed. I am looking right at them in the file system, installed from the latest versions on github. So I think it is something on ROS' side of things.

After playing with it some more, I discovered that multiple packages were not running. All of them - some turtlebot code, and some of my own packages - returned the same error as above. So I suspect something got messed up during the install of ROS.

Alright, so I've been poking at this for a few days now and pretty much gave up trying to get ROS to work correctly, and decided a re-flash was necessary. But I think I found something when I booted up my host machine. In my downloads folder, I have the v2.0 and the v1.2 JetPack. I know I used the v2.0 for this latest install, and it has been the only time I have used it (it provides some useful updates for OpenCV and bug fixes, among other things). I'm going to re-flash using the v1.2 JetPack this time, see if things behave better with ROS under that version. Its a long shot, but it is all I have to work with at the moment, and it shouldn't lose any ROS capabilities (aside from some of the stuff I wanted to do with OpenCV). I'll update everyone if that seems to work.
EDIT #4
Ok, everything seems to be working now. The problem does seem to be an issue with Jetpack v2.0. I suspect that some change, somewhere between v1.2 and v2.0 (made to accommodate the new TX1 board), messes with running ROS indigo on a TK1. I'm going to be a more detailed explanation in an answer to this question.

9250,Quadcopter PID: Controller is Saturating,"Good day,
I am currently creating an autonomous quadcopter using a cascading PID controller specifically a P-PID controller using angle as setpoints for the outer loop and angular velocities for the inner loop. I have just finished tuning the Roll PID last week with only +-5 degrees of error however it is very stable and is able to withstand disturbances by hand. I was able to tune it quickly on two nights however the pitch axis is a different story.
Introduction to the Problem:
The pitch is asymmetrical in weight (front heavy due to the stereo vision cameras placed in front). I have tried to move the battery backwards to compensate however due to the constraints of the DJI F450 frame it is still front heavy.
In a PID controller for an asymmetrical quadcopter, the I-gain is responsible for compensating as it is the one able to ""remember"" the accumulating error.
Problem at Hand
I saw that while tuning the pitch gains, I could not tune it further due to irregular oscillations which made it hard for me to pinpoint whether this is due to too high P, I or D gain. The quadcopter pitch PID settings are currently at Prate=0.0475 Irate=0.03 Drate=0.000180 Pstab=3 giving an error from the angle setpoint of 15degrees of +-10degrees. Here is the data with the corresponding video.
RATE Kp = 0.0475, Ki = 0.03, Kd = 0.000180 STAB Kp=3
Video: 
Plot:

Analysis of Results
It can be seen that the controller is saturating.
The motor controller is currently set to limit the pwm pulse used to control the ESC throttle to only 1800ms or 180 in the code (The maximum is 2000ms or 205) with the minimum set at 155 or 1115ms (enough for the quad to lift itselft up and feel weightless). I did this to make room for tuning the altitude/height PID controller while maintaining the throttle ratio of the 4 motors from their PID controllers.  

Is there something wrong on my implementation of limiting the maximum throttle?

Here is the implementation:

Possible solution
I have two possible solutions in mind

I could redesign the camera mount to be lighter by 20-30 grams. to be less front heavy
I could increase the maximum throttle but possibly leaving less room for the altitude/throttle control.


Does anyone know the optimum solution for this problem?

Additional information
The quadcopter weighs about 1.35kg and the motor/esc set from DJI (e310) is rated up to 2.5kgs with the recommended thrust per motor at 350g (1.4kg). Though a real world test here showed that it is capable at 400g per motor with a setup weighing at 1600g take-off weight 
How I tune the roll PID gains
I had set first the Rate PID gains. at a setpoint of zero dps

Set all gains to zero.
Increase P gain until response of the system to disturbances is in steady oscillation.
Increase D gain to remove the oscillations.
Increase I gain to correct long term errors or to bring oscillations to a setpoint (DC gain).
Repeat until desired system response is achieved

When I was using the single loop pid controller. I checked the data plots during testing and make adjustments such as increasing Kd to minimize oscillations and increasing Ki to bring the oscillations to a setpoint. I do a similar process with the cascaded PID controller.
The reason why the rate PID are small because rate Kp set at 0.1 with the other gains at zero already started to oscillate wildy (a characteristic of a too high P gain). 
I had set the Rate pid's such that it would maintain the angle I physically placed it to (setpoint at 0 degrees per second) 
I then used only P gain at the outer loop stabilize PID to translate the angle setpoint to velocity setpoint to be used to control the rate PID controller.
Here is the roll axis at 15 degrees set point 
Rate Kp = 0.07, Ki = 0.035, Kd = 0.0002 and Stabilize Kp = 2

It is very stable however the reaction time/rise time is too slow as evident in the video.

When we pull the syringe, the liquid is sucked into the syringe, while the other opening is shut. When the syringe is pushed, the liquid is ejected from the other end.
The quantity of liquid to be dispensed would be very small (400mg) so i am using small syringe of 1 or 2 ml .. as per my measurement, after every 100 dispensing operations, 1 ml syringe would be empty and we would need to pull liquid from the reservoir into the syringe, and do the dispensing again. 
My question is, I am unsure about the check valve here. Is there a 'Single' check valve available which would allow this kind of flow to happen ?

6 positions of the lasers : Fixed on the frame
6 orientations of the lasers : Fixed on the frame
The 6 measurements of the lasers
The quaternion from the IMU of my flight controller (PixHawk).
The origin is centered on the gravity center of the multi-rotor and defined as if the walls are perpendicular to each axes (the normal of the wall in X is (-1,0,0)) 

Output :

Position in 3D (X,Y,Z)
Angular position (quaternion)

Since I got the angular position of the multi-rotor, I rotated the laser positions and orientations via the quaternion, then extrapolate via the 6 measurements and I got the 3 walls. (orientations of the walls are trivial, then only one point is enough to determine its position.
Badly, I noticed that the yaw (rotation about z) measurement from the PixHawk is unreliable. Then I should measure the yaw from the lasers, but I do not success to do it. Event if the 2D problem is easy, I am lost in 3D.

9269,Suggestions on object types (features) to track from ARDrone 2 camera,"
UPDATE
  I have aded 50 bounty for this question on the StackOverflow

I am trying to implement object tracking from the camera(just one camera, no Z info). Camera has 720*1280 resolution, but I usually rescale it to 360*640 for faster processing.
This tracking is done from the robots camera and I want a system which would be as robust as possible. 
I will list what I did so far and what were the results.

I tried to do colour tracking, I would convert image to hsv colour space, do thresholding, some morphological transformations and then find the object with the biggest area. This approach made a fair tracking of the object, unless there are no other object with the same colour. As I was looking for the max and if there are any other objects bigger than the one I need, robot would go towards the bigger one
Then, I decided to track circled objects of the specific colour. However, it was difficult to find under different angles
Then, I decided to track square objects of specific colour. I used this




and then I checked this condition

if (approx.size() >= 4 && approx.size() <= 6)

and afterwards I checked for

solidity > 0.85 and aspect ratio between 0.85 and 1.15

But still result is not as robust as I would expect, especially the size. If there are several squares it would not find the needed one.

So, now I need some suggestions on what other features of the object could I use to improve tracking and how? As I mentioned above several times, one of the main problems is size. And I know the size of the object. However, I am not sure how I can make use of it, because I do not know the distance of the object from the camera and that is why I am not sure how to represent its size in pixel representation so that I can eliminate any other blobs that do not fall into that range.
UPDATE
In the third step, I described how I am going to detect squares with specific colour. Below are the examples of what I am getting. 
I used this HSV range for the red colour:

Scalar(250, 129, 0), Scalar(255, 255, 255), params to OpenCV's inRange function
HMIN = 250, HMAX = 255; SMIN = 129, SMAX = 255; VMIN = 0, VMAX = 255;
  (Would like to see your suggestions on tweaking this values as well)

So, in this picture you can see the processing; gaussian blurring (5*5),
morphological closing two times (5*5). And the image with the label ""result"" shows the tracked object (please look at the green square).

On the second frame, you can see that it cannot detect the ""red square"". The only main difference between these two pics is that I bended down the lid of the laptop (please look closer if you cannot notice). I suppose this happens because of the illumination, and this causes the thresholding to give not desired results. 

The only way, I can think of is doing two separate processing on the image. First, to do thresholding based on the colour as I was doing above. Then if I find the object to move to the next frame. If not to use this opencv's find squares method.
However, this method will involve doing too much of processing of the image.

9277,How to guide a camera through a circular tube?,"Let's say I have a 6-DOF flying camera and I want to make it move through a circular tube autonomously and let's suppose that the camera and the system that makes it fly are considered to be just a point in space. Which feature of the image I get from the camera can I use to move the camera appropriately, that is to get in one end of the tube and get out from the other? 
For example, I thought I could use edge detection. As the camera moves forward through the tube, due to the fact that its far plane is not infinitely away, there is a dark circle forming where the camera sees nothing surrounded by the walls of the tube. I think that ""preserving"" this circle might be the way to go (for example if it becomes an ellipse I have to move the camera accordingly for it to become a circle again), but what are the features that will help me ""preserve"" the circle?
I would like to use image-based visual servoing to do that. However, what troubles me is the following. In most visual-servoing applications I have seen, the control objective is to make some features ""look"" in a certain way from the camera point of view. For example, we have the projections of 4 points and we want the camera to move accordingly so that the projections' coordinates have some specific values. But the features are actually the same. 
In my case I thought that for example I could say that I want the projections of the 4 ""edge points"" of the circle/ellipse to take specific values so that they define a circle centered at the fov of the camera. But if the camera moves to achive this setup of features, then the 4 new ""edge points"" will correspond to the projections of 4 different real points of the pipe and the theory collapses. Am I right to think that? Any way to get past it?
Any oher ideas or relevant literature?

As per my research, I have found out that there can be 3 approaches

Auger based solution, where an auger is used to control the powder drop gravitationally. 



Volumetric
As powder quantities would be small, a metal rods with groove of proper volume can be designed to dispense powder. For keep powder flowing we can use a vibration motor to pour powder in the groove. A stepper motor can rotate the rod for dispensing the powder. I have made the rod bigger to show the concept, and then how it would be mounted in a cap so when we rotate it that much volume of powder is dropped from the cap.



Weight based measurement.
Dropping powder on to a weighing balance, and control it via feedback .. I think it would be a difficult thing to do, plus time consuming, provided we'd have to fill thousands of capsules.

Prio # 1 is accuracy, with an error margin of 1 -2 % .. secondly cost .. I'd like it not to be too costly .. 300 - 500 $. 
The metal powder is not magnetic .. is very fine .. and doesn't clump .. I have read articles and it appears by continues tapping the powder flow can be improved a lot.

Please watch my ""understanding steps"" and correct if I am wrong somewhere.
Lets assume I we have 2 vehicle positions described by 2 rotation quaternions:
$$
q_1 = w_1 + x_1i + y_1j +z_1k = \cos(\pi/4) + \sin(\pi/4)i
$$
This quaternion is normalized and represents rotation over the $x$ axis for $\pi/2$ angle as I understand it.
$$
q_2 = w_2 + x_2i + y_2j + z_2k = \cos(\pi/4) + \sin(\pi/4)k
$$
And this one represents rotation for the same angle $\pi/2$ over the $y$ axis.
$q_1*q_2 = q_3$ which would be the same rotation as if we made $q_1$ first and $q_2$ second.

9302,Output angle of DC motor - with current input,"What is your preferred time-domain method to simulate ideal position of a motor given an electrical-current input?
Assume that the goal is to plot the position output of a motor, based only on a constant electrical-current input.
For example, X amps are given to the motor. Plot the output Angle Y as a function of time, using only time-based tools (not Laplace or MATLAB outputs).
========= Two methods ===========
Here are two methods, which yield different results for some reason. Any ideas why they are not identical?
Input is a constant Current .
Method 1) Find updated velocity given an acceleration
acc[k] = (I[k]*Kt - b*vel[k-1]) / J
vel[k] = vel[k-1] + acc[k]*dt
pos[k+1] = pos[k] + vel[k]*dt +  0.5*acc[k]*dt^2
So, as desired, this is just a function of 'I'. This version has a less stable, oscillating output, regardless of which order vel and acc are computed in.
Method 2) Find velocity using difference between positions. This could obviously be a noisy result, in practice would need to be filtered.
acc[k] = (I[k]*Kt - b*vel[k]) / J
vel[k] = (pos[k] - pos[k-1]) / dt
pos[k+1] = pos[k] + vel[k]*dt +  0.5*acc[k]*dt^2
As before, this position equation is then ultimately just a function of I. However, this version has a smoother output.
=====================
Appendix 1: For method (1), assume an ideal current-driven DC motor Laplace model:
angVelocity/current = Kt/(Js+b); Kt is motor constant, J is rotor inertia, and b is damping.
Then acc*J + b*vel = current*Kt, so acc[k+1] = (current[k]*Kt - b*vel[k]) / J. As a reminder, vel[k] was found using the previous acceleration via v[k] = v[k-1] + acc[k-1]*dt as noted above in method #1.

I have seen this sensor being implemented on other projects however I could not find any papers that explain the use of this sensor in better detail. I have seen possible solutions on the raspberry pi one using interrupts and the other using Linux's multithreading.
If my understanding is right, to use interrupts, I need a some sort of data ready signal from the ultrasonic sensor. However this is not available in this particular sensor. Is it possible to use the echo pin as the positive edge trigger for the interrupt service routine (read sonar/calculate distance function). But would this not introduce inconsistent loop execution times which is bad for a consistent PID loop.
Another approach is to use multithreading using the wiring-pi library which enables me to run a function, let's say a function that triggers the sonar and calculates the distance along side the pid control loop. How would this affect the PID control loop rate?

9318,Understanding Drift in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM),"I am trying to understand the effect of drift in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). My understanding is that drift occurs because the robot tracks its position relative to a set of landmarks it is storing, but each landmark has a small error in its location. Therefore, an accumulation of these small errors over a long trajectory causes a large error by the end of the trajectory.
However, what I am confused about is what would happen when the robot tracks its way back to its starting positions. Suppose the robot starts in position A, and then starts to move along a path, mapping the environment as it does so, until it reaches position B. Now, the robot will have some error in its stored position of B, due to the drift during tracking. But then suppose the robot makes its way back to A, by tracking relative to all the landmarks it created during the first path. When it reaches A, will it be back at the true position of A, i.e. where it started the first path? Or will it have drifted away from A?
My intuition is that it will end up at the true position of A, because even though the landmarks have errors in them, as long as the error is not too large then the robot will eventually get back to the position where it stored the landmarks for A. And once it is there, those landmarks are definitely correct, without error, because they were initialized before any drift errors had started to accumulate.
Any help? Thanks!

9344,Which geo-projection to use for odometry,"I would like to make a little survey regarding the (geo)spatial projection that you use when elaborating your GPS and movement data for the spatial awareness of your robots. 
Moving all GPS coordinates to a planar projection seems to be the more reasonable choice since not only distances (for which several formulas and approximations exist), but bearings must be computed.
Generally, although scales are pretty small here, avoiding equirectangular approximation seems a good idea in order to keep a more consistent system.
Avoiding working in the 3D world (Haversine and other great-circle stuff) is probably a good idea too to keep computations low-cost.
Moving the world to a 2D projection is hence what seems to be the best solution, despite reprojection of all input GPS coordinates is needed. 
I would like to get opinions and ideas on the subject

9367,Relationship between motor torque and acceleration,"I am working on designing and building a small (1 1/2 lbs), 2-wheeled, differential drive Arduino-controlled autonomous robot. I have most of the electronics figured out, but I am having trouble understanding how much torque the motors will actually need to move the robot. I am trying to use the calculations shown here and the related calculator tool to determine what speed and torque I will need. I will be using wheels 32mm in diameter and one of Pololu's High-Power Micro Metal Gearmotors. I performed the calculations for a robot weight of 2 lbs to be safe and found that the 50:1 HP Micro Metal Gearmotors (625 RPM, 15 oz-in) should theoretically work fine, moving the robot at 3.43 ft/s with an acceleration of around 29 ft/s^2 up a 5-degree incline. 
However, I have not found an explanation for several things that I think would be very important to know when choosing drive motors. When the robot is not moving and the motors are turned on at full power, they should need to deliver their full stall torque. Based on the calculations, it seems that any amount of torque can get the robot moving, but the more torque, the faster the robot's acceleration. Is this true? Also, if the power source cannot supply the full stall current of the motors, will the robot not be able to start moving? In my case, I am powering the robot through a 7.2V (6S) 2200mAh NiMH battery pack that can provide around 2.6A continuously, and when it does that the voltage drops to less than 1V. Will this be able to power my motors? Once the robot reaches full speed and is no longer accelerating, theoretically the motors will not be providing any torque, but I do not think this is the case. Is it, and if so, how will I know how much torque they will be providing? Will the motors I chose have enough torque to move my robot?

9371,Reliably establishing communication and OI mode with Create 2,"I've started tinkering with a Create 2, but I'm having issues reliably getting it to accept my commands.  I can occasionally get it right, but sometimes, it just seems to ignore me.  I'm guessing my cleanup code isn't getting the state fully reset or something.  Is there a good pattern to follow for fail-safe initialization code?
Here's what I'm doing right now:

Pulse BRC low for 1 second
Wait 1 second
Send 16x 0 bytes (to make sure if it's waiting for the rest of a command, this completes it - seemed to help a bit when I added this)
Send 7 (reset)
Wait 10 seconds
Send 128 (start)
Wait 2 seconds
Send 149 35 (ask for the current OI state)
Wait 1 second
Send 131 (safe mode)

Sometimes I'm then able to issue 137 (drive) commands and have it work.  Most times it doesn't.  The times when it doesn't, I'm seeing a lot of data coming from the Create 2 that I'm not expecting, that looks something like this (hex bytes):

There's more, but my logging cut it off.  I get the same pattern a couple of times, and it seems to be at least partially repeating.  I thought maybe it's the 16 0-bytes I sent followed by 003f 2aff 7321 09cc 0a88, but I still don't know how to interpret that.
Sometimes it will make some noise for the reset command, but usually ignores the start/safe mode commands completely (I can tell because the green light stays on).

9372,Real-time object classification for an indoor autonomous quad-rotor,"I am designing an indoor autonomous drone. I am currently writing an object classification program in OpenCV for this purpose. My objects of interests for classification are: ceiling fans; AC units; wall and ceiling lamps, and; wall corners. I am using BoW clustering algorithm along with SVM classifier to achieve this (I'm still in the process of developing the code, and I might try other algorithms when testing).
The primary task of the drone is to successfully scan (what I mean by scanning is moving or hovering over the entire ceiling space) a ceiling space of a given closed region while successfully avoiding any obstacles (like ceiling fans, AC units, ceiling and wall lamps). The drone's navigation, or the scanning process over the ceiling space, should be in an organised pattern, preferably moving in tight zig-zag paths over the entire ceiling space.
Having said that, in order to achieve this goal, I'm trying to implement the following to achieve this:

On take off, fly around the given closed ceiling space and use SLAM to localise and map its environment.
While running SLAM, run the object classier algorithm to classify the objects of interests and track them in real time.
Once obtained a detail map of the environment and classified all objects of interest in the local environment, integrate both data together to form an unified map. Meaning on the SLAM output, label the classified objects obtained from the classifier algorithm. Now we a have fun comprehensive map of the environment with labeled objects of interest and real-time tracking of them (localization).
Now pick random corner on the map and plan a navigation pattern in order to scan the entire ceiling space. 

So the question now here is, is using object classification in real-time will yield successful results in multiple environments (the quad should be able to achieve the above mentioned tasks in any given environment)?. I'm using a lot of train image sets to train my classifier and BoW dictionary but I still feel this won't be a robust method since in real-time it will be harder to isolate an object of interest. Or, in order to overcome this, should I use real-situation like train images (currently my train images only contain isolated objects of interests)?
Or in my is using computer vision is redundant? Is my goal completely achievable only using SLAM? If, yes, how can I classify the objects of interest (I don't want my drone to fly into a running ceiling fan mistaking it for a wall corner or edge). Furthermore, is there any kind of other methods or sensors, of any type, to detect objects in motion? (using optical flow computer vision method here is useless because it's not robust enough in real-time).
Any help and advice is much appreciated.

The obstacle is represented as a circle of radius r1 ( in my code). I want to find the angles alpha_1 and alpha_2from the robot's local coordinate frame to the circle, as shown here:

So what I am doing is trying to find the angle from the robot to the line joining the robot and the circle's centre (this angle is called aux_t in my code), then find the angle between the tangent and the same line (called phi_c). Finally I would find the angles I want by adding and subtracting phi_c from aux_t. The diagram I am thinking of is shown:

The problem is that I am getting trouble with my code when I try to find the alpha angles: It starts calculating the angles correctly (though in negative values, not sure if this is causing my trouble) but as both the car and the circle get closer, phi_c becomes larger than aux_t and one of the alphas suddenly change its sign. For example I am getting this:
$$\begin{array}{c c c c} 
\text{aux_t} & \text{phi_c} & \text{alpha_1} & \text{alpha_2} \\ \hline
\text{-0.81} & \text{+0.52} & \text{-1.33} & \text{-0.29} \\

I obtain a 7D pose, i.e. 3D position vector + unit quaternion orientation, if I integrate the translational acceleration twice and propagate the orientation measurements.
If I want to add a new edge to the graph I need a constraint for that edge. In general, for pose graphs this constraint represents a relational transformation $z_{ij}$ between the vertex positions $x_i$ and $x_j$ that are connected by the edge. 
Comparing my case to the literature the following questions arised:

How do I calculate a prediction $\hat{z}_{ij}$ which I can compare to a measurement $z_{ij}$ when computing the edge error? Initially, I understood that graph slam models the vertex poses as gaussian distributed variables and thus a prediction is simply calculated by $\hat{z}_{ij}=x_i^{-1} x_j$. 
How do I calculate the information (preferred) or covariance matrix? 
How and when do I update the information matrices? During optimization? Or only at edge creation? At loop closure?

Studying current implementations (e.g. mrpt-graph-slam or g2o) I didn't really discover how predictions (or any probability density function) is involved.

9437,Can we simulate a actuator with a very strong torque with a PID controller,"I use gazebo to simulate a robot arm. To control its joints, I use PID controllers. As you might know, PID are sometimes pretty hard to tune and this is the case for a robotic arm. To avoid any tuning, and because I don't need the PID values to be realistic, I set to zero the derivative and integral parameters, increase a lot the proportional gain and add a lot of damping in my joints. By doing this, I can get a well working arm but only if I disable the gravity. 
My question is the following. Do you have an idea how I could simulate a very strong actuator with not necessarily realistic parameters?
EDIT 1: Setting the integral and derivative gain is stupid. The integral gain helps in correcting the effect of the gravity. The derivative gain counters the loss of stability and speed due to the integral gain. 
This question somehow leads to another. Do you know what tuning do the robotic arm manufacturer (big arms for car industry for example). I guess that this arm use actuators with a very strong torque and a low maximum speed which reduces the need of tuning.  
EDIT 2: More info on my setup. I use gazebo 6, with ODE. The robot description is in SDF. I control the robot with a model plugin. As a PID controler I use the PID class from the common library of gazebo and get directly the JointControler associated to the model.

I am currently using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) for the altitude estimation which has a resolution of 0.3cm.  However I found that the ultrasonic sensor's refresh rate of 20Hz is too slow to get a fast enough response for altitude correction.
I tried to use the accelerations on the Z axis from the accelerometer to get height data by integrating the acceleration to get velocity to be used for the rate PID in a cascaded pid controller scheme. The current implementation for the altitude PID controller is a single loop pid controller using a P controller with the position input from the ultrasonic sensor.
I had taken into account the negative acceleration measurements due to gravity but no matter how much I compute the offset, there is still the existence of a negative acceleration (eg. -0.0034). I computed the gravitational offset by setting the quadcopter to be still on a flat surface then collecting 20,000 samples from the accelerometer z axis to be averaged to get the ""offset"" which is stored as a constant variable. This variable is then subtracted from the accelerometer z-axis output to remove the offset and get it to ""zero"" if it is not accelerating. As said in the question, there is still the existence of a negative acceleration (eg. -0.0034). My quad then proceeds to just constantly climb in altitude. With only the ultrasonic sensor P controller, my quad oscillates by 50 cm.


How can this consistent negative acceleration reading be effectively dealt with?

Possible Solution:
I am planning to do a cascading PID contoller for the altitude hold with the innerloop (PID controller) using the accelerometer and the outer loop (P controller) using the sonar sensor. My adviser said that even a single loop P controller is enough to make the quadcopter hold its altitude even with a slow sensor. Is this enough? I noticed that with only the P gain, the quadcopter would overshoot its altitude.


Leaky Integrator: I found this article explaining how he dealt with the negative accelerations using a leaky integrator however I have a bit of trouble understanding why would it work since I think the negative error would just turn to a positive error not solving the problem. I'm not quite sure.

I want more information on how to make an RC transmitter myself, mainly the protocol that's used to send messages, and what circuitry is needed to actually transmit that, what kind of components do I need and how should I implement the software?

I'd rather not take apart my current RC controller and use an oscilloscope to decode the protocol. 
Any answers (short or long) and reading material is appreciated.
Other questions, can the protocol be implemented in software on an embedded system (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Intel Galileo, etc.)?

I want to control each one of the six joints despite the non-linearity produced by the chain structure, the gravity and the weight of the loads it could lift. 
I don't focus here on the speed nor the power limitations, I just want the arm to respond well. Moreover, I would like to avoid the use of any prior knowledge such as inertial computation. Then I had these considerations, considering that I can play with both the actuator design, and the loop feedback control system:

Limit the maximum speed of each actuator to smooth their error variation.
Increase the damping of the actuators to avoid high frequency instability.     
Find a good control system, such as a PID, to make sure the targets are reached without oscillations. 

Do you have any other considerations in mind? Do you know what process(es) industrial designers follow?
EDIT: As it is said in the comments, my question concern the design of an adaptive controller for a robot arm, which is, how to design a joint control system (actuator + loop control) that don't need inertia and masses to be computed (the controller could adapt to its own structure, or to the loads it lifts).

A rover

Objectives:

By putting the rover in an unknown location (x,y) in the room, the system should localize the rover's position
After the rover's coordinates will be known, Navigation will be the next step
We want the rover to navigate from the known coordinates (x1,y1) (let's say point A) to another point B on the map (x2,y2)
Control signals will be sent to the rover's servos to complete the navigation task

Methodology:

Camera will capture the environment in real time
Environment will be represented as cells (occupancy grid mapping)
Assume each cell represents 5 cm in the environment
Rover will be localized by the system point A
Determine the navigation to point B
Determine the path of the rover in the grid map (ex: go x cells horizontal then y cells vertical)
Control Signal will be sent to rover's servos

Questions:

Can I use this camera for this task or I need another type of cameras ?
What are the factors affecting the system accuracy ?
(ex: Sensor Resolution - FOV - FPS - Frequency Response - Distance of the camera in the ceiling)
What's is the most important factor to consider to increase the accuracy ?

While I was testing the PID, I noticed slow or weak response from PID controller (the quad shows no response at small angles). In other words, it seems that the quad's angle range has to be relatively large (above 15 degrees) for it to show a any response. Even then, the response always over shoots no matter what I, D gains I choose for my system. At low P, I can prevent overshoot but then it becomes too weak.   
I am not sure if the PID algorithm is the problem or if its some kinda bad hardware configuration (low IMU sample rate or maybe bad PWM configurations), but I have strong doubts about my PID code as I noticed changing some of the gains did not improve the system response.

Gazebo offers two options to control joints. One is a PID controller, provided by the  class. The other way is to directly set a torque to the joint. (The PID method too is ultimately implemented using torques).
Currently, I'm trying the PID-based implementation. I've used a P-only controller with damping on all joints (I've had to guess both values). However, there is a large amount of noise, and the difference between actual and desired position is at times as much as 10-12 degrees (especially when the foot of the robot hits the ground).
Does the actual motor use a PID controller as well? I can't seem to find the details here, Dynamixel EX-106 User's guide, but this link, Dynamixel EX-106+ Robot Actuator mentions ""Compliance/PID : Yes"".
If the motor does use a PID controller, then what are the parameters? And how does it allow us to set moving speed then?
If the motor doesn't use a PID controller, then what is the pattern of torque provided? In the manual (first link), I found this

From the current position 200 to 491 ( 512-16-5=491 ), movement  is 
  made  with appropriate  torque  to  reach  the  set  speed; from  491 
  to  507  ( 512-5=507 ), torque is continuously reduced to the Punch 
  value; from  507  through 517 (  512+5=517  ), no torque is generated.

This is rather vague though, and no further details are provided.
Also, I'm aware that extremely high damping and extremely high P-values might do the trick. But I want to simulate what actually happens on the motors, and that is probably not the way to go.

Regarding suspension it has a single shock for rear axle.
My plan is to put a bigger gear on the axle itself and then add a smaller gear to it on which some kind of sensor would measure number of its rotations. One rotation of the axle may be something like 20 rotations of the small gear. What kind of sensor can I use for sensing rotation?
Another way of making an odometer may be some kind of optical solution (disc with holes and an optical sensor) but this seems to be rather complicated and also the the direction of travel could not be easily estimated (unless the motor is running in some direction).

If I use magnetometer the declination angle will vary from place to place and so I will have to keep changing the declination angle. If I'm calculating based on just the GPS co-ordinates, it's not accurate. 
What is the best way to do this?  How do I calculate the above?

9608,Quaternion Kalman Filter Algorithm,"I have been stuck on this for weeks, I really hope that someone can help me with this,thank you in advance.
I am trying to write an IMU attitude estimation algorithm using quaternion kalman filter. So based on this research paper: , I have developed the following pseudo code algorithm:
Predict Stage:
Qk+1/k = Ak * Qk;  where Ak contains the gyro measurement. 

Pk+1/k = Ak * Pk *Ak.transpose() + Q; where Q is assumed to be zero.
After prediction, we can use this formula to get the supposed gravity measurement of accelerometer Yg in body frame :
Yg = R * G;  // R is the rotation matrix generated from quaternion Qk+1/k and G = (0,0,0,9.81).
This equation then translates to the following equation which allows me to get measurement model matrix H.
H * Qk+1/k = 0; //where H stores value related to (Yg-G).
Update Stage:
K = P * H * (H * P * H.transpose()+R)^(-1); //R should be adaptively adjusted but right now initialized as identity matrix
Qk+1/k+1 = (I-KH)Qk+1/k;
Qk+1/K+1 = (Qk+1/K+1)/|Qk+1/k+1|; //Normalize quaternion
Pk+1/K+1 = (I - KH)Pk+1/k;
The following is the main part of my code. The complete C++ code is at here  if you want to test.

The problem that I face is that my code does not work.The prediction stage works fine but the updated quaternion state is only correct for the first few iterations and it starts to drift away from the correct value. I have checked my code against the research paper multiple times and ensured that it is in accordance with the algorithm proposed by the research paper.
In my test, I am rotating around x axis by 60 degree per iterations. The number below the started is the angle of rotation. state and updated state is the predicted and updated quaternion respectivly while true value, meas, result are acceleration due to gravity in body frame.As the test result indicates, everything is way off after rotating 360 degrees.

9609,Most accurate rotation representation for small angles,"Assume that I have a rigid body for which I know that it can rotate with respect to a global reference frame (which is considered fixed and already given) for only a few degrees of angle, so I can describe its rotation by using the small angle approximation. For this system, I would like to know if there is a rotation representation that offers more accuracy when compared with other representation methods.
The main representation methods that I considered are the euler angles and the pitch-yaw-roll transformation. To my perception, I think that pitch-yaw-roll representation is expected to be more accurate, since all the angles are expressed with respect to the initial coordinate frame. On the other hand, euler angles are defined on different frames, so I am not sure if the resulting angles will be really small.
To sum up, I know that the body can rotate for only a few degrees and I would like to know which coordinate representation is much probable to deliver the smallest angles, such that the small angle approximation is more valid.
It could also be the case that there is not a general answer (so it depends on the specific configuration) but still I haven't found anything about this topic on the related literature!
Example (no small angle approx used): Assume I have a coordinate frame which describes a point in space by the following vector
$P2=\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \\ 0.05 \end{bmatrix}$.
Given another coordinate frame which is rotated with respect to the previous one, the description of the same point is given by     
$P1=\begin{bmatrix} 3.8933 \\
    1.3566 \\
   -0.0630 \end{bmatrix}$.
Using Euler angles, I can find that the rotation matrix $R_{euler}$ is characterized by the angles $0.1,0.2,0.1$ rads, which correspond to the angle of rotation around z axis, the rotation around the resulting y axis and the rotation around the resulting z axis, respectively (these are basic stuff, it is explained in many books.). So I have that $P1=R_{euler} P2$.
Now I want to find the corresponding rotation matrix if I use the pitch-yaw-roll representation. Here I have to solve an optimization problem and the solution that I get (maximum error between P1 and the estimated P1 is $3 \times 10^{-8}$) delivers me the following angles
$\begin{bmatrix}  -0.0103   \\ 0.0257  \\  0.0902\end{bmatrix}$,
which correspond to the rotation around the x,y and z axis of the initial coordinate frame.

9615,Orientation error with free rotations,"I am working on inverse kinematics for a 5DOF arm.  The tool is symmetric about its z-axis so we don't card about those rotations in the solution but we do care about the direction of the Z-axis.  in other words instead of the goal states orientation being $R = (N_d~ S_d ~A_d)$ we only care about $A_d$. How would I calculate the Orientation error (or adjust normal inverse kinematics) to account for this.  Setting $N_d$ and $S_d$ to zero or any value forces a particular orientation which may not be reachable.  for full 6DOF situations I have previously used the following equation for orientation error. 
$$E_o = \frac{1}{2} (N_e(q) \times N_d + S_e(q) \times S_d + A_e(Q) \times A_d)$$

is it sufficient to remove $N$ and $S$ from this equation giving
$$E_o = \frac{1}{2} (A_e(Q) \times A_d)$$
if not how else could I handle this situation?

Maximum torque: 800gf cm min (3V)
No-load speed: 1:48 (3V time)

I am not too fond of the max speed I can reach, but I would be able to provide more power, because I have a 12V 2A battery onboard.
So far I have used 6V, because that seemed to be the safer voltage choice.
Has anybody tried successfully higher voltages, without wearing down the motor in few hours (I've read this can happen)?
Alternatively, can someone recommend replacement motors that would tolerate reliably a higher power envelope?
I would like to preserve the gearbox and replace only the motor, if possible.
I think I could fit a motor 2-4 mm longer (replacing the transparent strap which bonds it to the gearbox), if that makes any difference.
BTW, I'm making the assumption:
higher_voltage => higher_torque => higher_speed
but I'm not sure it's overall correct.
I expect that it would at least produce higher acceleration during the transients.

Principle: Using the robot model and the path, the algorithm predict the behavior of the robot over N future steps to compute a sequence of commands $(v,\omega)$ to allow the robot to follow the path without overshooting the trajectory, allowing to slow down before a sharp turn, etc.
$v:$ Linear velocity
$\omega:$ Angular velocity
The robot: I have a non-holonomic robot like this one (Image extracted from the paper above) :

Here is my problem: Before implementing on the mobile robot, I'am trying to compute the needed matrices (using Matlab) to test the efficiency of this algorithm. At the end of the matrices computation some of them have dimension mismatch
What I did:
For those interested, this calculation is from 4 (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4) p6-7 of the paper.  

4.1 Model
$z_{k+1} =  Az_k + B_\phi\phi_k + B_rr_k$ (18) 
  with:
  $A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & Tv \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
  $B_\phi = \begin{bmatrix} {T^2\over2}v^2\\ Tv  \end{bmatrix}$
  $B_r = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -Tv \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
  $T$: sampling period
  $v$: linear velocity
  $k$: sampling index (i.e. $t= kT$)
  $z_k:$ the state vector $z_k = (d_k, \theta_k)^T$ position and angle difference to the reference path
  $r_k:$ the reference vector $r_k = (0, \psi_k)^T$ with $\psi_k$ is the reference angle of the path at step k 
4.2 Criterion
The predictive receding horizon controller is based on a minimization of the criterion
  $J= \Sigma^N_{n=0} (\hat{z}_{k+n} - r_{k+n})^T Q(\hat{z}_{k+n} - r_{k+n}) + \lambda\phi^2_{k+n}$, (20)
  Subject to the inequality constraint
  $ P\begin{bmatrix} v_n \\ v_n\phi_n \end{bmatrix} \leq q,$
  $n=0,..., N,$
  where $\hat{z}$ is the predicted output, $Q$ is a weight matric, $\lambda$ is a scalar weight, and $N$ is prediction horizon.
4.3 Predictor
An n-step predictor $\hat{z}_{k+n|k}$ is easily found from iterating (18). Stacking the predictions $\hat{z}_{k+n|k},n = n,...,N$ in the vector $\hat{Z}$ yields
  $\hat{Z} = \begin{bmatrix} \hat{z}_{k|k} \\ \vdots \\ \hat{z}_{k+N|k}\end{bmatrix} = Fz_k + G_\phi\Phi_k + G_rR_k$  (22)
  with
  $\Phi_k = \begin{bmatrix} \phi_k, \ldots, \phi_{k+N}\end{bmatrix}^T$,
  $R_k = \begin{bmatrix} r_k, \ldots, r_{k+N}\end{bmatrix}^T$,
  and
  $F = \begin{bmatrix}I & A & \ldots & A^N \end{bmatrix}^T$
  $G_i = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 \\ B_i & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 \\ AB_i & B_i & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\ \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & 0 & 0 \\ A^{N-1}B_i & \ldots & AB_i & B_i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  

where index $i$ should be substituted with either $\phi$ or $r$

4.4 Controller
Using the N-step predictor (22) simplifies the criterion (20) to
  $J_k = (\hat{Z}_k - R_k)^T I_q (\hat{Z}_k - R_k) + \lambda\Phi^T_k\Phi_k$, (23)
  where $I_q$ is a diagonal matrix of appropriate dimension with instances of Q in the diagonal. The unconstrained controller is found by minimizing (23) with respect to $\Phi$:
  $\Phi_k = -L_zz_k - L_rR_k$, (24)
  with
  $L_z = (lambda + G^T_wI_qG_w)^{-1}G^T_wI_qF$
  $L_r = (lambda + G^T_wI_qG_w)^{-1}G^T_wI_q(Gr - I)$

I'am trying to compute $\Phi_k = -L_zz_k - L_rR_k$ but the dimension of $L_r$ and $R_k$ does not match for matrix multiplication.
Parameters are :   

$T=0.1s$
$N=10$
$\lambda=0.0001$
$Q=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \delta \end{bmatrix}$ with $\delta=0.02$

I get :
$R_k$ a (11x2) matrix (N+1 elements of size 2x1, transposed)
$G_w$ a (22x11) matrix
$G^T_w$ a (11x22) matrix
$I_q$ a (22x22) matrix
$F$ a (22x2) matrix
$G_r$ a (22x22) matrix    
so Lz computation gives (according to the matrix sizes)
$L_z=(scalar + (11x22)(22x22)(22x11))^{-1} (11x22)(22x22)(22x22)$
a (11x2) matrix.
as $z_k$ is (2x1) matrix, doing $L_zz_k$ from (24) is fine.  
and Lr computation gives (according to the matrix sizes)
$L_r=(scalar + (11x22)(22x22)(22x11))^{-1} (11x22)(22x22)((22x22) - (22x22))$
a (11x22) matrix.
as $R_k$ is (11x2) matrix, doing $L_rR_k$ from (24) is not possible.
I have a (11x22) matrix multiplicated by a (11x2) matrix.
I'm sure I'm missing something big here but unable to see what exactly.
Any help appreciated.

Are the advantages/disadvantages basically the same as the differences between electric and nitro RC cars or does the bigger scale adds something important to the game? I can think of the main differences like bigger range and faster ""refueling"" with IC and less maintenance with electric but I am interested in a detailed comparison.
The transmission for the IC engine is considered to be automatic.
EDIT: The fuel injection for IC is considered to be electronic (EFI) but I do not know whether that also means the ""electronic"" throttle (no mechanical wire as with carburetor?). Whatever the throttle may be I see the lag between its ""actuation"" and the engine running into higher RPM and giving more power/speed as the main disadvantage for IC control - however, it may probably be quite easy dealt with in software (by adding some timeout when checking desired RPM).

9629,Quadcopter refuses to fly when the Yaw PID component is added,"Good day,
I would like to ask why is it that when I add the Yaw control to my PID controller for each motor. The quadcopter refuses to take off or maintain its altitude. I am curently using a Cascaded PID controller for attitude hold using an Accelerometer, a Magnetometer and a Gyroscope, and a 40Hz Ultrasonic Sensor for Altitude Hold. Since the scope is indoor I have done away with the barometer due to its +-12m error. 
Resulting Response
Without Yaw Control, the plot below shows the response of the quadrotor.

With Yaw Control, the plot below shows the response of the quadrotor.

Debugging
I found out that each of the outputs from each PID's give a too high of a value such that when summed together goes way over the PWM limit of 205 or Full Throttle.

Without yawPID contribution
The limiter kicks in without damaging the desired response of the system thus is still able to fly albeit with oscillatory motion along the z axis or height



With yawPID contribution
The added yaw components increases the sum of the PID's way above the limit thus the limiter compesates the excess too much resulting in an over all lower PWM output for all motors thus the quad never leaves the ground.



//Motor Front Left (1)
float motorPwm1 =  pitchPID + rollPID + yawPID + baseThrottle + baseCompensation;
//Motor Front Right (2)
float motorPwm2 =  pitchPID - rollPID - yawPID + baseThrottle + baseCompensation; 
//Motor Back Left (3)
float motorPwm3 = -pitchPID + rollPID - yawPID + baseThrottle + baseCompensation; 
//Motor Back Right (4)
float motorPwm4 = -pitchPID - rollPID + yawPID + baseThrottle + baseCompensation;

Background
The PID parameters for the Pitch, Yaw and Roll were tuned individually meaning, the base throttle was set to a minimum value required for the quadcopter to be able to lift itself.
The PID parameters for the Altitude Sensor is tuned with the other controllers active (Pitch and Roll).
Possible Problem

Limiter algorithm

A possible problem is that the algorithm I used to limit the maximum and the minimum throttle value may have caused the problem. The following code is used to maintain the ratio of the motor values instead of limiting them. The code is used as a two stage limiter. In the 1st stage, if one motorPWM is less than the set baseThrottle, the algorithm increases each motor PWM value until none of them are below that. In the 2nd stage, if one motorPWM is more than the set maxThrottle, the algorithm decreases each motor PWM value until none of them are above that. 

This was obtained from pixhawk. However the difference is that they employ only upper bound compensation limiting, while mine also performs lower bound compensation limiting which may cause more saturation once it reaches the second stage.

From:

Gains are set too high.

It is also possible that I've set my P gains too high thus exceeding the max RPM limit of the motors causing the Limiter algorithm to overcompensate.
Current PID Settings:
The minimum motor value for the quad to lift itself is 160 while the maximum limit is 200 from the PWM time high of 2000ms 

Pitch (Cascaded P-PID controller)
Rate P = 0.07
Rate I = 0.03
Rate D = 0.0001
Stabilize P = 2
Roll (Cascaded P-PID controller)
Rate P = 0.09
Rate I = 0.03
Rate D = 0.0001
Stabilize P = 2
Yaw (Cascaded P-PID controller)
Rate P = 0.09
Rate I = 0.03
Rate D = 0.0001
Stabilize P = 2
Hover (Single loop PD controller)
P = 0.7
D = 35

Possible Solution
I think I have set the PID parameters particularly the P or D gain too high that the computed sum of the outputs of the controller is beyond the limit. Maybe retuning them would help.

I would just like to ask if anyone has encountered this problem or if you have any suggestions. Thank you :) 

EDIT
I have added the plots of the response when the control loop is fast (500Hz) and Slow (300Hz)

The setup is a differential robot with IMU, wheel encoders and a magnetic compass. 
A complementary filter is used for fusing gyroZ and odo measurements to estimate the heading, and then correct it with a Kalman filter using the magnetic compass.
My problem occurs when the robot heading is close to -pi/pi .
The estimated heading is useless even though the robot is not even moving.
I am thinking this must be a very common problem and probably has a better solution than what I came up with, which was either re-initializing the integrator when crossing zero, adding 180 degrees each time the error is larger, or just ignoring the compass if the error is too large...
It's my first Kalman filter so I may have made a poor implementation if this is not a common issue...

E.g. if the point mass is moving at $$x=10$$ with a velocity of 100 m/s in positive $x$-direction it cannot immediately go to $$x=9.9$$ due to its inertia. However, I have the feeling that my thoughts are wrong...
The background is the following:
I am trying to understand what holonomic and nonholonomic systems are. What I found so far:
Mathematically:

Holonomic system are systems for which all constraints are integrable into positional constraints.
Nonholonomic systems are systems which have constraints that are nonintegrable into positional constraints. 

Intuitively:

Holonomic system where a robot can move in any direction in the configuration space. 
Nonholonomic systems are systems where the velocities (magnitude and or direction) and other derivatives of the position are constraint.

I have attached the DH-Parameters. Apart from this I have also tried many other combination of orientations but to no useful effect.

The problems is that the robot base rotates counter-clockwise by default for positive increases in , while the original robot moves in the opposite direction. Similarly for the wrist roll, i.e. Joint 4, the direction of simulation is reversed.
In order to confirm that it's not my mistake only, I searched for similar ready made simulation software. Although it did not include the same KUKA robot, a similar variant (KUKA_KR_5_sixx_R650) was available. Hence, KUKA_KR_5_sixx_R650 had one set of motions for base and wrist in RoKiSim v1.7 for positive increases in joint angle and reverse motion in roboanalyzerv7  .

My firmware is r3_robot/tags/release-3.2.6:4975 CLEAN
The Create 2 is connected to an Arduino, and the BRC is driven by one of the Arduino pins.  I verified on a DMM that the voltage is indeed toggling.  I am able to both send and receive serial data between the Arduino and Create2.
Pseudo-code:

Initialize roomba.  Connect serial at 115200 baud.  Toggle BRC: high for 200 ms, low for 200 ms, then high again.  Leave it high.
Ask roomba to stream sensor data in passive mode.  Wait 1 second after BRC toggle to give some extra time to wake-up.  Then send opcode 7 (reset), wait for reset message to complete by looking for the last few characters, then wait another second for good measure.  Next, send opcode 128 (start into passive mode), wait 100 ms to let opcode stick, then ask for stream of data (opcode 148 followed by number of packet IDs and the packet IDs themselves).
Main loop: Echo data from Create2 to the serial-USB output of the Arduino so that I can view the Create2 data.  The data sent by the Create2 look valid (good checksum) and are sent in the expected time interval of ~15 ms.  The main loop also toggles the BRC low for 1 second every minute.

9686,Performing inverse kinematics based on a displacement of the end effector?,"I think i have an simple problem, but can't my head around how i should resolve it...
My setup looks like this: 


The grey box on end effector is supposed to be an camera, which measures a dx,dy,dz between the object and the camera. These are used to  position the camera such that dz between the object and the camera is equal to 0.5, and dx = dy = 0. 
I know that I using inverse kinematics can determine the Q which positions it according the given rotation and position, but what if I only provide it a position only?
How do extract all Q that make dx = dy = 0, and dz = 0.5, while keeping the object in sight at all time?
An example could be if an object was placed just above the base (see second image), it should then find all possible configurations which in this case would consist of the arm rotating around the object, while the camera keeps the object in sight...
Update
I just realized a possible solution would be to create a sphere with the object in centrum  an radius of dz, and then use this sphere to extract all pairs of rotations and position... But how would one come by with such an solution?

I know at all time how far the object is relative to the endeffector, and radius of the sphere is the desired distance i want between the object and endeffector.  
I want by using inverse kinematics pan around this object in a sphere shaped trajectory. 
Each transformation matrix should contain different positions on the sphere and the rotation should be oriented such that the arm looks at the object. 
The position should be relative easy to compute, as i already know the distance to to object, and radius of the sphere.

I am planning to use VFH+ for 2D trajectory planning, meaning movements of the quadcopter are only available on the X and Y axes and no movement is permitted along the Z axis or Altitude.
I currently have no methods implemented on position tracking. Accelerometers have been known to generate a lot of errors from integration. I tried to look for optical flow sensors for low computation needed however have found no luck as most of them are out of stock (probably due to company change (Agilent/Avago to Pixart)). 
From what I understand, when the after the certainty/occupancy grid is constructed and reduced to a polar coordinate system, the robot's heading is aligned to the computed unblocked sector.

Is it possible to generate the occupancy grid without position feedback?

For the steering mechanism, I wanted to implement an Ackerman's steering. I've read about the principle and have understood its basics. Now to actually make the design, I am currently using switchboards, sold here in India, they are surprisingly strong, lightweight, waterproof(they are switchboards) and cheap. Now I got 1 big axle and the small axle cut out already, along with the two L-shaped pieces that join the 2 axles together... I'm just now confused as to how to connect the wheels to the axle and how to make them rotate along side it. The site won't let me upload any pics right now, I'll try again ASAP.
I have the switchboard, an electric drill and will to do anything to make this happen ( ;P ). I don't have access to a 3D Printer.
Any help would be greatly appreciated...  
P.S- And if you have any suggestions of your own, which might be better for my robot, feel free to share them, I'm just looking for a good steering method for my robot.

9709,Is my servo fried?,"I got a new servo a few days back (RC Servo, Futaba FP-S148). I first tested it out with the Sweep sketch on Arduino, powering it with the Arduino 5v and GND pins only. It was working, just fine.
Today I was trying to use it in my robot and I tried powering it with 2 LiPo batteries (Samsung ICR16850 2200mAh, from an old laptop battery) connected in series, giving 8.32v. As soon as I connected my servo, it started rotating randomly, I had not connected it to my Arduino yet. I quickly took it out.
Next, I used a L7805 to get 5.13v regulated supply out of my batteries that I used earlier. When I connected my batteries to the servo, and the servo to the Arduino, uploaded the sketch, the servo started behaving rather strangely, it first did a complete turn and then stopped. Only a humming sound came from the servo. Strange thing is, whenever I connect one of my Multimeter leads to the power cables, the servo immediately turned in the opposite direction only as long as only lead was in contact with either the positive or negative wire.
Otherwise, the servo just gives a humming sound.
Have I fried my servo? Or is it some other issue?
UPDATE 1
I stripped down the servo and checked the motor. It is working fine, seems like this is a gear problem.

9728,How to check for a sharp angle with a line follower?,"I have the mBot robot and I want to program it to follow the line. So far it can pass any kind of line that is >90.
I want it to be able to pass 90-ish angles as well. Like this one:

The problem is that my mBot robot has only 2 line following sensors (they are 5 mm apart and the line is 2 cm wide) so I can't use just the sensors.

Most of the times it just goes to the line and when it's supposed to turn it just misses the line (goes on the white) and goes back to get back on track. Once it's back on the black line it once again tries to go forward but goes on the white instead of taking a turn. This happens endlessly.
Sometimes it passes the angle by going back and forth and accidentally turning, but that's not even a workaround, let alone a solution.
Here's a test course of the first round of the competition.

My robot can pass this without a problem, but it gets stuck on this (poorly edited, sorry) course:

It can't pass the 20 block if the robot enters it from a 15 or 20 block (so basically it gets stuck if it's coming from an angle and hits a 90 degree turn).
The sensor value could be read as either 0, 1, 2 or 3 depending on what the robot currently sees:

0 - on the line 
1 - on the right of the line 
2 - on the left of the line 
3 - not on the line

9739,Quadcopter Flight Controller:Why does Using gyroscope data give better results?,"I have succeeded in making my first quadcopter from scratch with a readymade frame. I designed the flight controller myself with help from YMFC-3D youtube series of videos. 
But in the process, I discovered that using the euler angles or the 'ypr' values from the MPU6050 as the feeback to the PID loop makes it super difficult to tune the quadcopter and even then it doesn't fly great. 
Whereas although not intuitive to me, using the gyroscope values with a complementary filter instantly made the quad respond much better and the tuning also was not too difficult.
Let me clearly define the response in both cases.
Using ypr values:-
+Always keeps overshooting or 'underreaching'
+Very small range of values that can let the quad fly stable
+Drastic Reactions to extreme values of P (Kp)values
Using gyro values:-
+Reaction is much more stable
+Tuning the PID was also simple
+ Even under high values of P(Kp) the quad might crash due to oscillations but not flip or react extremely

9751,Measuring vehicle's forward and lateral acceleration using a smartphone,"I want to measure the acceleration (forward and lateral separately) using an android smartphone device in order to be able to analyse the driving behavior. 
My approach would be as follows:
1. Aligning coordinate systems
Calibration (no motion / first motion):
While the car is stationary, I would calculate the magnitude of gravity using  and rotate it straight to the z-axis (pointing downwards assuming a flat surface). That way, the pitch and roll angles should be near zero and equal to the angles of the car relativ to the world.
After this, I would start moving straight forward with the car to get a first motion indication using Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER and rotate this magnitude straight to the x-axis (pointing forward). This way, the yaw angle should be equal to the vehicle's heading relativ to the world.
Update Orientation (while driving):
To be able to keep the coordinate systems aligned while driving I am going to use Sensor.TYPE_GRAVITY to maintain the roll and pitch of the system via


where A_x,y,z is the acceleration of gravity. 
Usually, the yaw angle would be maintained via Sensor.ROTATION_VECTOR or Sensor.MAGNETIC_FIELD. However, the reason behind not using them is because I am going to use the application also in electrical vehicles. The high amounts of volts and ampere produced by the engine would presumably make the accuracy of those sensor values suffer. Hence, the best alternative that I know (although not optimal) is using the GPS course to maintain the yaw angle.
2. Getting measurements
By applying all aforementioned rotations it should be possible to maintain an alignment between the smartphone's and vehicle's coordinate systems and, hence, giving me the pure forward and lateral acceleration values on the x-axis and y-axis.
Questions:

Is this approach applicable or did I miss something crucial?
Is there an easier/alternative approach to this?

9754,Are all Flight Controllers and Remote Controls using the same protocol?,"I'm about to start a project, where I'm sniffing data between remote controls and flight controllers on RC copters and doing stuff with that information.  Do all (or most) flight controllers use the same protocol to communicate with the remote controls, or does it vary based on which one you buy?  I would be testing on drones (DJI phantom and the like).  
So, my real question is:
If I want to write something to read the data, will I need to buy a different flight controller for each protocol used, or do they all use the same protocol, and I can just buy one flight controller, and the info I can get out will be the same for all types of flight controllers?
Also, are the protocols only spoken by the ground remote control and the flight controller?  Does the receiver care what protocol is being used, or is it just a middle man?

9755,Dead Reckoning: Obtaining Position Estimation from Accelerometer Acceleration Integration,"Good day,
I have been reading papers about position integration from accelerometer readings.
I have consulted this paper from freescale on how that is achievable and this article regarding leaky integrators to help in preventing accumulation of errors from integration.
I was testing this algorithm by moving the imu by approximately 0.1 meter. The algorithm does get it right at the instant it arrives at approx 0.1 meter however when left still at that position, the integrated position goes to zero.
It turns out the velocity readings become negative at a certain period after reaching 0.1 meters.

Does anyone have any suggestions in dealing with this error?

Plots (Red is the position, Blue is the velocity.)
The imu(accelerometer) was moved alternating positions 0 meters and 0.1 meters with a stop of approximately 3-5 seconds in between before moving to the next position

9756,Step size in numerical differentiation,"I get position information and a corresponding timestamp from a motion tracking system (for a rigid body) at 120 Hz. The position is in sub-millimeter precision, but I'm not too sure about the time stamp, I can get it as floating point number in seconds from the motion tracking software. To get the velocity, I use the difference between two samples divided by the $\Delta t$ of the two samples:
$\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \dfrac{\mathbf{x}[k] - \mathbf{x}[k-1]}{t[k]-t[k-1]}$.
The result looks fine, but a bit noisy at times. A realized that I get much smoother results when I choose the differentiation step $h$ larger, e.g. $h=10$:
$\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \dfrac{\mathbf{x}[k] - \mathbf{x}[k-h]}{t[k]-t[k-h]}$.
On the other hand, peaks in the velocity signal begin to fade if I choose $h$ too large. Unfortunately, I didn't figure out why I get a smoother signal with a bigger step $h$. Does someone have a hint? Is there a general rule which differentiation step size is optimal with respect to smoothness vs. ""accuracy""?

9770,Mobile robot algorithm implementation error,"I am working in reproducing a robotics paper, first simulating it in MATLAB in order to implement it to a real robot afterwards. The robot's model is:
$$\dot{x}=V(t)cos\theta $$
$$\dot{y}=V(t)sin\theta$$
$$\dot{\theta}=u$$
The idea is to apply an algorithm to avoid obstacles and reach a determines target. This algorithm uses a cone vision to measure the obstacle's properties. The information required to apply this system is:
1) The minimum distance  $ d(t) $ between the robot and the obstacle (this obstacle is modelled as a circle of know radius $ R $).
2) The obstacle's speed  $ v_{obs}(t) $
3)The angles $ \alpha_{1}(t)$ and $ \alpha_{2}(t)$  that form the robot's cone vision, and
4) the heading $ H(t) $  from the robot to the target
First a safe distance  $ d_{safe}$  between the robot and the obstacle is defined. The robot has to reach the target without being closer than        $ d_{safe}$ to the obstacle.
An extended angle $ \alpha_{0} \ge arccos\left(\frac{R}{R+d_{safe}} \right) $  is defined, where $ 0 \le \alpha_{0} \le \pi $ 
Then the following auxiliary angles are calculated:
$ \beta_{1}(t)=\alpha_{1}(t)-\alpha_{0}(t)$ 
$ \beta_{2}=\alpha_{2}(t)+\alpha_{0}(t)$ 
Then the following vectors are defined:
$ l_{1}=(V_{max}-V)[cos(\beta_{1}(t)),sin(\beta_{1}(t))]$ 
$ l_{2}=(V_{max}-V)[cos(\beta_{2}(t)),sin(\beta_{1}(2))]$ 
here $ V_{max}$  is the maximum robot's speed and  $ V $ a constant that fulfills  $ \|v_{obs}(t)\| \le V \le V_{max} $ 
This vectors represent the boundaries of the cone vision of the vehicle
Given the vectors $ l_{1} $  and $ l_{2}$ , the angle $ \alpha(l_1,l_2)$  is the angle between $ l_{1}$  and $ l_{2} $  measured in counterclockwise direction, with $  \alpha \in (-\pi,\pi) $ . Then the function $f$ is 
The evasion maneuver starts at time $t_0$. For that the robot find the index h:
$h = min|\alpha(v_{obs}(t_0)+l_j(t_0),v_R(t_0))|$
where $j={1,2}$ and $v_R(t)$ is the robot's velocity vector 
Then, from the two vectors  $v_{obs}(t_0)+l_j(t_0)$ we choose that one that forms the smallest angle with the robot's velocity vector. Once h is determinded, the control law is applied:
$u(t)=-U_{max}f(v_{obs}(t)+l_h(t),v_R(t))$
$V(t)=\|v_{obs}(t)+l_h(t)\| \quad \quad (1)$ 
This is a sliding mode type control law, that steers the robot's velocity  $v_R(t)$ towards a switching surface equal to the vector $v_{obs}(t)+l_h(t)$. Ideally the robot avoids the obstacle by surrounding it a 
While the robot is not avoiding an obstacle it follows a control law:
$u(t)=0$
$V(t)=V_{max} \quad \quad  (2) $    
Hence the rules to switch between the two laws are:
R10 Switching from (2) to (1) occurs whenthe distance to the obstacle is equal to a constant C, which means when $d(t_0)=C$ and this distance is becoming smaller in time  i.e. $\dot{d(t)}<0$
R11 Switching from (1) to (2) occurs when $d(t_*)<1.1a_*$ and the vehicle is pointing towards the obstacle, i.e. $\theta(t_*)=H(T_*)$
where $a_*=\frac{R}{cos\alpha_0}-R $
Ideally the result should be similar to this
But I'm getting this instead
While I understand the theory there's obviously a flaw in my implementation that I haven't been able to solve. In my opinion the robot manages to avoid the obstacle but at certain point (in the red circle), the robot turns to the wrong side, making impossible the condition $H(t) = \theta(t) $ to be achieved.
I feel that I am not measuring properly the angle alpha between the $v_{obs}(t)+l_h(t)$ and $v_{R}(t)$ , because while debugging I can see that at certain point it stops switching between negative and positive values and become only positive, leading the robot's to the wrong side. It also seems to be related with my problem here: Angle to a circle tangent line

Problem is that the output i am getting is pretty large.. Which making me suspect that some of the output might be wrong. The simulation i am using constrains the rotation to 360 degrees.. I think something goes wrong.. 
The only reason I could think would do this, would be if the jacobian i am was using had singularities... Which why i assumed that i was running into singualarity issue..

The transform basically computes the rotation matrix. The math is based on the on this post by @Ben, which is an answer to a similar problem i am having..      
Update
Error with the rotation matrix was due to the polar coordinate being 0 => sin(0) = 0. 
I made this plot displaying the determinant of the jacobian, while i compute the inverse kinematics for the large displacement. For each inverse kinematics iteration, I set the robot to the new q_i and use that as current and continue computing until i reach the end configuration. 

It seems that alot of them goes toward a singularity or in general a pretty low number..
Update
Again i think the singularities might be the culprit here..

Everytime i compute a new Q I set the robot in that state, and perform inverse kinematics from that state.. Q is the joint angles for the 6 joints. 
Update
Interpolation is done by lineary dividing the path from start to end into a specified amount of of data points.  

This plot shows  each tranformation matrices generated from the interpolation and with their the position part plotted. The red dots is the path (every 1000th position). The blue ball is the object in want to track, and green dots represents the sphere.. As I am only doing this for the first point on the sphere, it only hits one point on the sphere, which is the top point, which the plot also shows. 
Rotation doesn't show that much change, which also makes sense based difference between the current and desired rotations.

I am pretty sure that my interpolation works, as the plot shows.  My inverse kinematics on the other hand not so sure..
Update
@Chuck mentions in his answer that it would be a good idea to check the core functionality, which might shed some light on what could be going wrong. 
I tried it with an inv.kin function i know would work, which didn't return any result, which make me doubt whether my transformation function i create is accurate?
The robot simulation is the one shown above..  The  Transform function shown above, is the function which i use to compute my desired, and provide my inverse kinematics..  Is something incorrectly setup?

Update
@Chuck came up with an different approach to my problem, which only has 3 DOF, being the position.  I choose change track, and peform a simple inverse kinematics given a distance dx,dy,dz.. Which for some reason isn't working quite good for me? even for small differences...

    jq =  this->device.get()->baseJframe(this->toolFrame,state).e();


    //Least square solver - dq = [j(q)]T (j(q)[j(q)]T)1 du  <=> dq = A*du
    Eigen::MatrixXd A (6,6);

    //A = jq.transpose()*(jq*jq.transpose()).inverse();
    A = (jq*jq.transpose()).inverse()*jq.transpose();

    Vector3D<> dif_p = t_tool_base_desired.P()-t_tool_base_current.P();
    cout <<""difference: "" <<dif_p << endl;

    Eigen::VectorXd du(6);
    du(0) = dif_p[0];
    du(1) = dif_p[1];
    du(2) = dif_p[2];

    du(3) = 0;
    du(4) = 0;
    du(5) = 0;

    Eigen::VectorXd q(6);
    q = A*du;

    Q q_current;
    q_current = this->device->getQ(this->state);
    Q dq(q);
    Q q_new = q_current+ dq;

9786,"How do the PID parameters (Kp, Ki, and Kd) affect the heading of a differential driving robot when they are increased individually?","
Question: A PID controller has three parameters Kp, Ki and Kd which could affect the output performance. A differential driving robot is controlled by a PID controller. The heading information is sensed by a compass sensor. The moving forward speed is kept constant. The PID controller is able to control the heading information to follow a given direction. Explain the outcome on the differential driving robot performance when the three parameters are increased individually. 

This is a question that has come up in a past paper but most likely won't show up this year but it still worries me. It's the only question that has me thinking for quite some time. 
I'd love an answer in simple terms. Most stuff i've read on the internet don't make much sense to me as it goes heavy into the detail and off topic for my case.  
My take on this:
I know that the proportional term, Kp, is entirely based on the error and that, let's say, double the error would mean doubling Kp (applying proportional force). This therefore implies that increasing Kp is a result of the robot heading in the wrong direction so Kp is increased to ensure the robot goes on the right direction or at least tries to reduce the error as time passes so an increase in Kp would affect the robot in such a way to adjust the heading of the robot so it stays on the right path.
The derivative term, Kd, is based on the rate of change of the error so an increase in Kd implies that the rate of change of error has increased over time so double the error would result in double the force. An increase by double the change in the robot's heading would take place if the robot's heading is doubled in error from the previous feedback result. Kd causes the robot to react faster as the error increases. 
An increase in the integral term, Ki, means that the error is increased over time. The integral accounts for the sum of error over time. Even a small increase in the error would increase the integral so the robot would have to head in the right direction for an equal amount of time for the integral to balance to zero. 
I would appreciate a much better answer and it would be great to be confident for a similar upcoming question in the finals.

9839,Which mechanical device could repeatedly present an ID tag to a card-reader,"I'm trying to build a test-automation robotic arm which can repeatedly present an ID-tag (such as RFID or NFC card or fob) to a card reader.
I suspect our reader fails either (a) after hundreds of presentations or due to fast presentations or (b) at a specific moment in the reader duty cycle.
The tag needs to move in a well-controlled manner:

Quickly present the card, 
Pause (mark)
Quickly remove the card,
Pause (space)
Repeat at 1.

I'm calling the present/remove sequence the mark-space ratio for simplicity.
The tests I want to perform involve varying (a) the frequency and (b) the mark-space ratio, to (a) stress-test and  (b) boundary-test the re-presentation guard times built into the reader to debounce presentations.
The guard times are around 400ms, response around 100ms, so I need something that can move in and out of a 5-10cm range quickly and repeat within those sorts of timescales. 
The distance the card needs to move depends on the reader model, as they have different field ranges. I want to get through the edge of the field quickly to avoid any inconsistencies in testing.
I'm able to do any programming (professional) and simple electromechanical design and build (ex-professional, now hobbyist). I only need to build one, it doesn't have to be particularly robust, but it does need to be fairly accurate with regard to the timings to do the second test.
What I've done so far:
I've built one version already using a Raspberry Pi, GPIO, a stepper motor with an aluminium arm screwed to a wheel.  It works, but it's a bit jerky and too slow, even with a 30cm arm to amplify the motion. It will probably do for the repeat test, but it's not time-accurate enough to do the timing tests.
My other design ideas were: 

Servo (are these also slow?)
Solenoid (fast, but too limited range? and might cause EM?)
Motor (too uncontrollable, and will require too much mechanical work for me)
Rotating drum (fast, stable, but cannot control mark-space ratio)

I'm not a electro-mechanical design expert, so I'm wondering if I'm missing an electrical device or mechanical design which can do this more easily.

I am at moment working with an robot arm (UR) with an camera mounted on to its TCP.  The application i am trying to create is a simple ball tracking application which tracks the movement of the ball, while always keeping the object within sight. 
which meant that I needed some form of path planning algorithm which plans the path between my current state and the desired state. The path should should be such that the ball is always kept in focus while the arm moves to the desired state.
But then I began question myself whether it was a bit overkill, and whether a simple straight line interpolation wouldn't suffice?.. I am actual not sure what form of benefit i would have by choosing a pathplanner, than a simple interpolation..
Interpolation would also generate the path I desire, so why choose a pathPlanner at all?

the robot I am using is a UR5, and TCP has a stereo camera mounted on to it. The idea is to move the end effector according to the object being tracked. 
The path-planning algorithm for this system should comply with some rules. 

The path which it creates should be collision free, and always keep the object being tracked at sight at all time. 

Having a path that keeps the object in sight has been bit of problem.  Sometime will the end effector rotate around itself, messing up  measurements taken and thus the tracking itself. 

It should be able to maneuver away from static obstacles. 

A Possible solution?
I thought of a possible solution. Since my current state and desired state is defined by two different sphere, A possible solution would be to create a straight line between each center of each sphere, and between the current position and desired position, such that a straight path in between could be computed easily.  which always keeps itself oriented toward the object. Problems is that I am not sure how I should handle collision here.

Mathematically:
Holonomic system are systems for which all constraints are integrable into positional constraints.
Nonholonomic systems are systems which have constraints that are nonintegrable into positional constraints.
Intuitively:
Holonomic system where a robot can move in any direction in the configuration space.
Nonholonomic systems are systems where the velocities (magnitude and or direction) and other derivatives of the position are constraint.

9851,How do I evaluate the minimum requirements of the processor and camera for a visual SLAM robot?,"I would like to build a visual SLAM robot (just for self-learning purpose) but I get frustrated how I know which processor and camera should be used for visual SLAM. 
First, for the processor, I have seen three articles, which shows different systems are used for implementing their SLAM algorithm:

Implementing SLAM algorithm (however it uses ultrasonic sensor rather than visual sensor) in Raspberry Pi (processing power is only 700 MHz) in Implementing Odometry and SLAM Algorithms on a Raspberry Pi to Drive a Rover 
I have also seen that Boston Dynamics use Pentium CPU, PC104 stack and QNX OS for their Big Dog project, BigDog Overview
November 22, 2008
Then, I also found a project uses a modern XILINX Zynq-7020 System-on-Chip (a device that combines FPGA resources with a dual ARM Cortex-A9 on
a single chip), for a Synchronized Visual-Inertial Sensor System, in A synchronized visual-inertial sensor system with FPGA pre-processing for accurate real-time SLAM

But after reading those, I have no clue how they end up with those decisions to use those kinds of processors, stacks or even OSes for their project. Is there a mathematical way, or a general practice, to evaluate the minimum requirement of the system (as cheap and as power efficient as possible) for an algorithm to run? 
If not, how could I know what processor or system I have to prepare for a visual SLAM robot? If there is no simple answer, it is also cool if you can recommend something I could read to have a good start.
Secondly, I also cannot find clear information which camera I should use for a visual SLAM robot. I also have no idea how they evaluate the minimum requirement of the camera. I found a lot of papers saying they use RGB-D camera but when I Google to find one, there are very few commercially available. The one I found is Xtion Pro Live from ASUS Global (for $170 which is quite affordable for me), but they are out of stock. Are there any practice I can choose a suitable camera system for visual SLAM too? 
Sorry if my question is too long. I feel that choosing the system and camera looks like a thing that requires a lot of experience and background knowledge. So rather than direct suggestions, it is cool if you have some ideas/recommended resources for me to learn the general ways people make such decisions in general or in similar projects, if any.

9893,Computing the Jacobian Matrix -- chain rule?,"I am learning about robot kinematics and the Jacobian matrix, and I'm trying to understand how to compute the Jacobian matrix given a kinematic chain, such as a robot arm. I understand the theory behind the Jacobian matrix, but I'm not sure actually how it would be calculated in practice.
So, let's say that I have a 7 DoF robot arm, with 7 joints and 6 links between the joints. I know how to compute the transformation matrix between each joint, and by applying forward kinematics, I know the pose of the end effector for any configuration of joint angles. To calculate this, I have written some code which stores each transformation matrix, and then multiplies them in series to create the transformation matrix between the first joint and the end effector.
However, how do I now go about computing the Jacobian matrix? My solution so far, is to write down each transformation matrix by hand, then multiply them all by hand, to yield the overall transformation matrix, with respect to the joint angles. I could then differentiate this to create the Jacobian matrix. The problem with this though, is that the maths becomes very, very complicated as I move along the kinematic chain. By the end, there are so many terms as a result of the multiple matrix multiplications, that it just becomes so tedious doing this by hand.
Is there a better way to do this? In the case of calculating the forward kinematics, I didn't have to do it by hand, I just wrote some code to multiply the individual matrices. But when I want the Jacobian matrix, it seems like I need to compute the derivative of the overall transformation matrix after it has been computed, and so I need to do this by hand. What's the standard solution to this? Is it something to do with the chain rule for differentiation...? I'm not sure exactly how this applies here though...

9904,Solving Inverse Kinematics with Gradient Descent,"I am trying to implement my own inverse kinematics solver for a robot arm. My solution is a standard iterative one, where at each step, I compute the Jacobian and the pseudo-inverse Jacobian, then compute the Euclidean distance between the end effector and the target, and from these I then compute the next joint angles by following the gradient with respect to the end effector distance.
This achieves a reasonable, smooth path towards the solution. However, during my reading, I have learned that typically, there are in fact multiple solutions, particularly when there are many degrees of freedom. But the gradient descent solution I have implemented only reaches one solution.
So my questions are as follows:

How can I compute all the solutions? Can I write down the full forward kinematics equation, set it equal to the desired end effector position, and then solve the linear equations? Or is there a better way?
Is there anything of interest about the particular solution that is achieved by using my gradient descent method? For example, is it guaranteed to be the solution that can be reached the fastest by the robot?
Are there cases when the gradient descent method will fail? For example, is it possible that it could fall into a local minimum? Or is the function convex, and hence has a single global minimum?

9926,Calculate the uncertainty of a 6-dof pose for graph-based SLAM,"This question is strongly related to my other question over here.
I am estimating 6-DOF poses $x_{i}$ of a trajectory using a graph-based SLAM approach. The estimation is based on 6-DOF transformation measurements $z_{ij}$ with uncertainty $\Sigma_{ij}$ which connect the poses. 
To avoid singularities I represent both poses and transforms with a 7x1 vector consisting of a 3D-vector and a unit-quaternion:
$$x_{i} = \left( \begin{matrix} t \\ q \end{matrix} \right)$$
The optimization yields 6x1 manifold increment vectors 
$$ \Delta \tilde{x}_i = \left( \begin{matrix} t \\ log(q) \end{matrix} \right)$$
which are applied to the pose estimates after each optimization iteration:
$$ x_i \leftarrow x_i \boxplus \Delta \tilde{x}_i$$
The uncertainty gets involved during the hessian update in the optimization step:
$$ \tilde{H}_{[ii]} += \tilde{A}_{ij}^T \Sigma_{ij}^{-1} \tilde{A}_{ij} $$
where 
$$ \tilde{A}_{ij} \leftarrow A_{ij} M_{i} = \frac{\partial e_{ij}(x)}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial x_i \boxplus \Delta \tilde{x}_i}{\partial \Delta x_i} |_{\Delta \tilde{x}_i = 0}$$
and
$$ e_{ij} = log \left( (x_{j} \ominus x_{i}) \ominus z_{ij} \right) $$
is the error function between a measurement $z_{ij}$ and its estimate $\hat{z}_{ij} = x_j \ominus x_i$. Since $\tilde{A}_{ij}$ is a 6x6 matrix and we're optimizing for 6-DOF $\Sigma_{ij}$ is also a 6x6 matrix.

Based on IMU measurements of acceleration $a$ and rotational velocity $\omega$ one can build up a 6x6 sensor noise matrix
$$ \Sigma_{sensor} = \left( \begin{matrix} \sigma_{a}^2 & 0 \\ 0 & \sigma_{\omega}^2 \end{matrix} \right) $$
Further we have a process model which integrates acceleration twice and rotational velocity once to obtain a pose measurement.
To properly model the uncertainty both sensor noise and integration noise have to be considered (anything else?). Thus, I want to calculate the uncertainty as
$$ \Sigma_{ij}^{t} = J_{iterate} \Sigma_{ij}^{t-1} J_{iterate}^T + J_{process} \Sigma_{sensor} J_{process}^T$$
where $J_{iterate} = \frac{\partial x_{i}^{t}}{\partial x_{i}^{t-1}}$ and $J_{process} = \frac{\partial x_{i}^{t}}{\partial \xi_{i}^{t}}$ and current measurement $\xi{i}^{t} = [a,\omega]$.
According to this formula $\Sigma_{ij}$ is a 7x7 matrix, but I need a 6x6 matrix instead. I think I have to include a manifold projection somewhere, but how?

For further details take a look at the following publication, especially at their algorithm 2:

I use the cholesky based sparse solver implementation of Eigen which fails with a numeric error.
Of course, the failure might occur due to a bug in my implementation. But maybe there's also a problem about representing the math with computers, e.g. some overflow in double representation or something similar. Could anybody comment on this assumption, please?

For the outermost PID controller, the setpoint is 0 m/s with the measured velocities obtained from integrating linear accelerations from the accelerometer. This then controls the PID controller responsible for the Pitch (if Y velocity PID) and Roll (if X velocity PID).

9951,Why do series elastic actuators have more accurate and stable force control?,"The other day, somebody was telling me about a robot in their lab, and they mentioned that it has ""series elastic"" actuators. But after doing a bit of Googling, I'm still not sure as to what this means, and have been unable to find a simple explanation. It seems that it is something to do with the link between the actuator and the load having a spring-like quality to it, but this is rather vague...
In any case, the what I am really interested in is the advantages and disadvantages of series elastic actuators. Specifically, I have read that one of the advantages is that it allows for ""more accurate and stable force control"". However, this appears counter-intuitive to me. I would have thought that if the link between the actuator and the load was more ""springy"", then this would lower the ability to have accurate control over the force send to the load, because more of this force would be stored and dissipated in the spring, with less directly transferred to the load.
So: Why do series elastic actuators have ""more accurate and stable force control""?

 $\overrightarrow x = \begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\z \end{bmatrix}$
so that 
$H \overrightarrow x = \begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\z\\x\\y\\z \end{bmatrix}$
which represents both sensors reading the exact position of the robot. Makes sense so far. The problem comes when I compute the innovation covariance
$S_k = R + HP_{k|k-1}H^T$
Since 
$H H^T = \begin{bmatrix}

Proceeding from here, my gain matrix ($K = P_{k|k-1} H^T S_k^{-1}$) winds up doing some pretty odd stuff (swapping rows and the like) so that, when updating a static system ($A = I_3, B = [0]$) with a constant measurement $\overrightarrow z = [1,0,0]$ I wind up with a predicted state $\hat x = [0,0,1]$.
If I separate the sensors and update the filter with each measurement separately, then $H H^T = I_3$, and I get sensible results.
I think I am confused about some technical points in one or more of these steps. Where am I going wrong? Does it not make sense to vertically concatenate the observation matrices?
I suppose that I could just set the off-diagonal 3x3 blocks of $S_k$ to 0, since I know that the sensors are independent, but is there anything in the theory that suggests or incorporates this step?

The two obstacles in the environment are identical to each other.
Each robot can see both obstacles but not each other. Therefore have angle theta 1 and 2 combined with distance 1 and 2. Can the distance between the two robots be calculated?

So far I have placed circles with radius of the measured distance over each landmark (triangles in my workings), this provides 4 possible positions for each robot. Red and black circles correspond to robot 1 and blue and green to robot 2. Using the relative size of the angle measurements I can discount two of these positions per robot.
This still leaves me with two possible positions for each robot shown with the filled or hashed circles.

Is it possible to calculate which side the robot is to the landmarks and the distance between each other?
Robot 1 only has the two measurements of angle and distance and can therefore assign an id to each obstacle, but when information is transmitted to robot 2, robot 2 does not know which obstacle will have been designated an id of 1 or 2.

Radius of the cylinder - r
Robot's distance from the cylinder
Wheel thickness - 1.5 cm
Distance between the middle of each wheel - 11.5 cm

How would I achieve the above path?
The only thing I saw was this SO question that says: 

The distance between the left and right wheel of the robot is 6
  inches.
So the left wheel should travel at a distance of 2(pi)(radius+6)
And the right wheel should travel at a distance of 2(pi) (radius-6)

The problem with my robot is that you can't tell it to go 20cm to the right, nor can you tell it to turn 90 degrees to the right.
All you can do is set each motor's speed 0-255, so there's not way to put it in the formula disatance = time x speed.
I assume I have to set each motor's speed to a different value so they would go in a circle of radius x and then just exit at the half of the circle (like shown in the picture)

There exists a single equation which determines the end effector pose, given the set of joint angles, and we want to determine the parameters in that equation (the joint angles).
But how does this relate to the least-squares problem, where there are multiple measurements? Is the problem I am trying to solve essentially the same, except that the number of measurements is one? And in that case, is using Ceres Solver's non-linear least squares solver really necessary?

However, I don't understand why these are not all the same thing. If you want to send a robot arm to a certain position, then you could use position control. But in order to move an actuator to a certain position, you need to give it a velocity. And in order to give it a velocity, you need to give it a torque.

I already have an Rpi and I know that pin 18 is the PWM pin that controls the motor's precision movement, but before I purchase a PWM controller and additional motors I need to run some testing to find how precise the motor is.
By the way, how can I calculate the amount of weight the motor can handle?
Any ideas and information will be greatly appreciated.
Thank you

10059,In how many ways can a six propellers drone fly or rotate?,"I thought it were twelve ways:

Six for each ways between two propellers
Six others for each rotation on these ways.

But according to Vijay Kumar Dean of Penn Engineering , it seems that I was wrong...
Then I read this article  about modeling and robust trajectory tracking control for a novel Six-Rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and this one about navigation and autonomous control of a Hexacopter in indoor environments but was never able to find such an information.
I then guessed that 3 of the rotors could go one direction and three others into another which would add 6 other ways for rotating and therefore 6 others for simply flying but that is only a guess.

10060,Motor Choice given size constraint and load requirement,"Good day everyone :)
I am an undergraduate student working on a project involving the use of high torque small-sized DC motors for use in designing a person following trolley bag. Where in the problem is to use small sized motors but still maintain the usability and efficiency in carrying loaded luggages.
I have been looking for motors in local stores as well as in RS components as well as Element 14. However I am not sure if my choices are the right fit as I am at a loss on what specifications to look for when selecting a particular motor for this application. I have also tried to look for motors used in current products that can be used in my application such as todays electric skate boards but unfortunately have no luck on finding their suppliers.

Basically the question I would like to ask  is what specifications or calculations can I perform to select the proper motors given size constraints and weight carrying requirments. Or does anyone have suggestions on common motors that are already normally used for this application. My target maximum load capacity is 20kg.

10077,How are industrial robotics components purchased?,"For hobbyists, you go to a store to buy products. The prices for these products are all clearly listed in the store catalog, and you can easily search for parts by lowest price or read customer reviews of the products.
For industrial engineers building complex machines, how do they buy components? Or don't they worry about cost, and leave it to their employer to eat the cost as a part of doing their line of work?
Is it possible to ""shop around"" for low-cost engineering components?

It is unclear to me how someone building a robot on their own as a small one-man startup can make the step from the world of toy robots, to larger and more industrial robotic components.
Most of the non-hobbyist stuff is hidden away and not exposed to the world. While a product catalog might be available, there are no prices listed for anything.
For larger industrial components, there does not seem to be any realistic way to shop around for the lowest price or best value, since pricing for much of the big stuff is basically unavailable.

For me personally, I am interested in trying to build my own powered exoskeleton on a middle class American income, so I can't afford to be paying 1000 bucks for a single electrohydraulic proportioning servo valve, when I'll need probably 50 of them. But shopping around for low cost ones is basically impossible as far as I can determine, because pricing info is generally not available or searchable from the majority of manufacturers.

10087,Task space to joint motion space conversion,"I am the moment trying to read and understand this paper Task Constrained Motion Planning in Robot Joint Space but seem to have a hard time understanding the math.  
The paper describes how to perform task constrained motion planning in cases where a frame is constrained to a specific task.
the problem the paper tackles is when sampling in joint space, randomized planners typically produce samples that lie outside the constraint manifold. the method  they proposed methods use a specified motion constrain vector to formulate a distance metric in task space and project samples within a tolerance distance of the constrain.   
Given the this I am seem to a bit confused on some simple terms they define in this paper. 
Examples. How is a task space coordinate defined ? what information does it have?
they compute the $$\Delta x = T_e^t(q_s)$$ which is transformation matrix of the end effector with respect to the task frame. 
What I don't get is why the end effector? and why the end effector with respect to the task frame?
Secondly.
Later in the paper they write down an expression that relates the task space to the joint space motion. They do it using the Jacobian, but seem to miss explaining (in my opinion) what $E(q_s)$ actually do. 
$$J(q_s) = E(q_s)J^t(q_s)$$
What is said about it in the paper is that 

Given the configuration $q_s$, instantaneous velocities have a linear
  relationship $E(q_s)$

why the need of instaneous? what is the definition of an instantaneous component? how does it differ from the information given by the jacobian?
Basically i don't understand how and why the mapping is as it is?..

10101,Ultrasonic Sensor through a column,"I am trying to measure the height of water inside a column. The column is 50mm in dia and 304mm long. I have mounted the sensor just above the column.

To measure the accuracy of the sensor, I filled the column up to a known value (a) and got the average sensor reading (b). a+b should give me the height of the sensor from the base of the column.
Repeating this for different values of a, I got very different values for (a+b). see attached chart.

My question is

Is the sensor expected to have error of this order? 
Is my setup of confining the sensor through a column producing such errors. 
Any other ideas to get the water column height. Please note that during the actual test, the water inside will be oscillating (up and down).I am thinking of making a capacitive sensor using aluminium foil. Water will work as the dielectric and the level of water will determine the capacitance.

10115,SLAM - odometry motion model,"I am making a project with a 4 wheeled differential robot to make visual SLAM using a stereo rig. I have some encoders to measure de displacement and the steering angle of the robot and I want to use the odometry motion model in the fastSLAM algorithm.
To use the odometry motion model you need to calculate the values it needs from the odometry reading (incremental encoders), $u_t=(\bar{x}_{t-1},\bar{x_t})$ where $\bar{x}_{t-1}=(\bar{x}\>\bar{y}\>\bar{\theta})$ and $\bar{x}_t=(\bar{x}'\>\bar{y}'\>\bar{\theta}')$ are the previous and the current pose extracted from the odometry of the vehicle.
My question is about how to obtain those values from the encoders. I guess that in this case I would need to obtain the equations from the geometric model for the differential robot:
$D_L=\frac{2\cdot\pi \cdot R_L}{N_c}\cdot N_L$
$D_R=\frac{2\cdot\pi \cdot R_R}{N_c}\cdot N_R$
$D_T=\frac{D_L+D_R}{2}$
$\Delta\theta=\frac{D_L-D_R}{L}$
where $D_L$ is the advance of the left wheel, $D_R$ is the advance of the right wheel, $R_L$ is the lecture from the left encoder, $R_R$ the lecture from the right encoder, $N_C$ the total number of pulses of the encoder type, $D$ is the total distance achieved by the robot and $\theta$ the angle steered. $L$ is the distance between the wheels.
Using those equations is possible to obtain the pose in every time step:
$\bar{x}_{t}=\bar{x}_{t-1}+D\cos(\theta_{t-1})$
$\bar{y}_{t}=\bar{y}_{t-1}+D\sin(\theta_{t-1})$
$\bar{\theta}_{t}=\bar{\theta}_{t-1}+\Delta\theta$
So those last are the values I need to inject to the modometry motion model and then add gaussian noise to them.
Am I right? Or is there another way of computing the pose from odometry for a differential 4-wheel robot?

My general plan for this project was to make a arm that when fully extended would only be around 40-50(max) cm long. It would be consisted of light weight aluminum and I am hoping for it to weigh only a couple of pounds when done.

My option right now are:

2- tilt sensor  (bad FP rate)
3- wooden conductive 
I would like to know if someone has other ideas (that affordable - less than 30$ dollar per target might be o.k)
Edit: the target is static, and just waiting to a robot to touch it.
Edit: The specs are:
1- The target dimension is 1 meter height, 0.5 meter width , 0.3 depth.
2- To trigger the target ,the robot should be around 10 centimeter long to any point of the target surface.
3-To trigger the target the robot needs to get close up to 10 centimeter or even press with around 1 Newton force. the robot might even throw an object that satisfy the previous condition.
4-Detection must be only from intentional touch.
5-Wooden conductive is trigger because a human is Electrically conductive. this might not be the option when we throw an object.
6- Target will be placed outdoor, so the sensor need to be wind-resistance (not extreme wind condition- just around 20-25 km/h)
7- I  prefer a sensor that detect touch (more than proximity)because it might make my solution more cheap and reliable(in factor of amount sensors as i estimate).

10195,Starting out: Arduino vs Raspberry Pi drone,"For my dissertation project, I will have to use a drone. What it will do is look for an object in a closed space.
What I will most deffinately need are:

A camera
Sensors to avoid collision
PC communication: 


stream video 
receive directions (the pc will control the drone, give it directions etc)


Now I'm wondering what would be the best platform to build on considering these requirements and I have absolutely no idea what's going on in the microcontroller world. So I don't know which of the two has more shields and whatnot that would be suitable for my needs.

10196,Using Quaternions to feed a quadcopter PID stabilizing controller to avoid Gimbal lock,"I am trying to control my F450 dji quadcopter using a PID controller. From my IMU, I am getting the quaternions, then I convert them to Euler's angles, this is causing me to have the Gimbal lock issue. However, is there a way that I directly use the quaternions to generate my control commands without converting them to Euler's angle?
This conversation here discusses a similar issue but without mentioning a clear answer for my problem.
The three errors so far I am trying to drive to 0 are:

where the Master generates the desired rotation and the Slave is the IMU.
UPDATE:
Here are some pieces of my code:
Getting the current and the reference quaternions for bot the Master and the Slave from the ROTATION_VECTOR:
/** Master's current quaternion */
double x   = measurements.get(1);
double y   = measurements.get(2);
double z   = measurements.get(3);
double w   = measurements.get(4);

/** Slave's current quaternion */
double xS  = measurements.get(5);
double yS  = measurements.get(6);
double zS  = measurements.get(7);
double wS  = measurements.get(8);

/** Master's Reference quaternion */
double x0  = measurements.get(9);
double y0  = measurements.get(10);
double z0  = measurements.get(11);
double w0  = measurements.get(12);

/** Slave's Reference quaternion.
 *  If the code has not been initialized yet, save the current quaternion
 *  of the slave as the slave's reference orientation. The orientation of
 *  the slave will henceforth be computed relative to this initial
 *  orientation.
 */
if (!initialized) {
    x0S = xS;
    y0S = yS;
    z0S = zS;
    w0S = wS;
    initialized = true;
}

Then I want to know the orientation of the current quaternion relative to the reference quaternion for both the Master and the Slave. 
/**
     * Compute the orientation of the current quaternion relative to the
     * reference quaternion, where the relative quaternion is given by the
     * quaternion product: q0 * conj(q)
     *
     * (w0 + x0*i + y0*j + z0*k) * (w - x*i - y*j - z*k).
     *
     * <pre>
     * See: 
     * 
     * </pre>
     */
    // For the Master
    double wr = w * w0 + x * x0 + y * y0 + z * z0;
    double xr = w * x0 - x * w0 + y * z0 - z * y0;
    double yr = w * y0 - x * z0 - y * w0 + z * x0;
    double zr = w * z0 + x * y0 - y * x0 - z * w0;

    // For the Slave
    double wrS = wS * w0S + xS * x0S + yS * y0S + zS * z0S;
    double xrS = wS * x0S - xS * w0S + yS * z0S - zS * y0S;
    double yrS = wS * y0S - xS * z0S - yS * w0S + zS * x0S;
    double zrS = wS * z0S + xS * y0S - yS * x0S - zS * w0S;

Finally, I calculate the Euler angles:
/**
     * Compute the roll and pitch adopting the TaitBryan angles. z-y'-x"" sequence.
     *
     * <pre>
     * See 
     * or  
     * </pre>
     */
    double rollMaster  =  Math.atan2(2 * (wr * xr + yr * zr), 1 - 2 * (xr * xr + yr * yr));
    double pitchMaster =  Math.asin( 2 * (wr * yr - zr * xr));
    double yawMaster   =  Math.atan2(2 * (wr * zr + xr * yr), 1 - 2 * (yr * yr + zr * zr));

and I do the same thing for the Slave. 
At the beginning, the reference quaternion should be equal to the current quaternion for each of the Slave and the Master, and thus, the relative roll, pitch and yaw should be all zeros, but they are not!

What I am asking is why do I only get an angle of rotation of 0 or 1 degrees when the robot is moving in a circle. The angle should be incrementing while the robot is moving. 
The output I am getting on the serial monitor shows a line of what looks like garble which I assume is supposed to be the bytes sent back from the Create which is followed by ""Angle: 0 (or 1)"" What I was expecting to see was an increasing angle value. (1,2,3...360, and so on).

10213,Triangulation from calibrated stereo rig,"I am using a stereo rig to do SLAM, calibrated using the MATLAB Calibration Tool. I need to compute the 2D coordinates of a landmark using the observation model obtained from triangulation (the images are rectified). 
The equations obtained from triangulation are the ones presented in the blue box here. Because I am doing SLAM in 2D the coordinates I need to use are $Z_p$ and $X_p$. The parameters needed to compute those values are $f$, $T$ and $disparity (x_L - x_R)$.
After doing the calibration intrinsics matrices $K_L$ and $K_R$ are obtained and a common intrinsic matrix for the stereo rig is calculated from $K = 1/2*(K_L +K_R)$ so I get the parameters needed in triangulation from  this common matrix.
The focal length is supplied from the manufacturer, and for my Logitech C170 is 2.3mm. The baseline $T$ from the calibration is 78.7803 mm. To compute the disparity I am obtaining SURF points and using RANSAC to discard the outliers so I get x coordinates from both rectified images.
The problem is that with those values I can't obtain correct values for $Z_p$ and $X_p$ and I am not sure why or where I am doing the wrong step. Anyone can help with this? Are those the correct steps to do triangulation from rectified stereo images?
EDIT: My stereo rig looks like the figure I attach:
If you compare the coordinates system with the one used in the link before is easy to see that my $X_r$ corresponds to the $Z_p$ from the link and the $Y_r$ corresponds to $X_p$, so the equations to calculate the distance using triangulation and with the coordinate system of the figure are:
$x_r=\frac{fb}{x_L-x_R}$
$y_r = \frac{(x_L-p_x)b}{x_L-x_R}-\frac{b}{2}$ 
Being $f$ the focal length, $b$ the baseline, $p_x$ the x coordinate of the central point and $x_L-x_R$ the disparity. The $X_r$ $Y_r$ coordinate system is situated between the two cameras, so this is the meaning of the $\frac{b}{2}$ displacement in the equations.
Calibration 
To obtain the cameras calibration I am using the Stereo Camera Calibrator Toolbox with the chessboard pattern.
After calibration, I made some tests using MATLAB functions triangulate and reconstructScene to know whether the parameteres are well calculated. The distances I obtained using this functions (which use the stereoParams object created by the calibrator) works well and I obtain distances very similar to the actual ones. So I suposse the calibration works well.
The problem, as I explained before, is when I try to calculate the distances using the equations $x_r$ and $y_r$ because I am not sure how to obtain the common matrix $K$ for the stereo rig (the calibrator gives one intrinsic matrix for each camera, so you have two matrices).
The value of the baseline given from calibration make sense, I made a measurement with a ruler and gives me 78 mm approximately.
The $f$ value I assume should be in pixels but here again the calibration gives an $f_x$ and $f_y$ value so I am not sure which one should I use.
Those are the intrinsic matrices I obtain:
Left: 
$\begin{pmatrix} 672.6879&-0.7752&282.2488\\0&674.3705&240.1287\\0&0&1 \end{pmatrix}$
Right: $\begin{pmatrix} 681.7049&0.0451&331.2612\\0&681.8235&246.1209\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix}$

10249,Fence avoidance for manually controlled robot,"I'm trying to find known techniques for keeping a manually controlled robot within a known polygon fence. More specifically, a pilot controls a robot by issuing desired velocity vectors, and the autopilot adjusts the velocity so that the distance to any boundary is always at least the stopping distance of the robot.
My goal is to implement a system that:

Tries to follow the pilot's desired velocity as closely as possible.
Is robust to changes in position and desired velocity. At a minimum, I want the velocity to change continuously with respect to the position of the robot and desired velocity of the pilot. Informally, this means that sufficiently small changes in the position or desired velocity of the pilot induce arbitrarily small changes in the velocity.

The second point is particularly important. Suppose that the policy were to find the intersection with the boundary in the direction of the desired velocity and slow down smoothly to that point. The below figure depicts a couple of scenarios in which this would not be continuous. In this figure, the black lines represent the fence boundary, the red dot is the position of the robot, and the blue line is the desired velocity of the pilot. In figure (a), a small perturbation of the position to the left will cause a large increase in allowed velocity because the desired velocity will intersect the far edge instead of the near edge. In figure (b), a small clockwise rotation of the velocity vector will result in a large decrease in allowed velocity because the desired velocity will intersect the near edge instead of the far edge.

I have searched for relevant papers, but most of the papers I've seen have dealt with fully autonomous obstacle avoidance. Moreover, I haven't seen any papers address the robustness/continuity of the system.
:EDIT:
The robot knows its own location and the location of the boundary at all times. I also have some equations for maximum velocity that allow a smooth ramp-down to a single line boundary (though I'd be interested in seeing a better one). I would like the velocity limits to be continuous in the position and desired velocity of the pilot.
I want to continuously throttle the user's input such that a minimum safe distance between the robot and the boundary is maintained, but see the figure that I added to the question. The hard part (I think) is to make sure that small changes in position (e.g. due to sensor noise) or small changes in desired velocity (e.g. due to pilot noise) don't cause huge changes in what the autopilot allows.
I want continuity because I think it will provide a much nicer experience for the pilot while still enforcing the fence boundary. There is a trade-off with optimally but I think this is worth it. Even though the physical world smoothes any discontinuities in velocity, big changes could still cause large jerk which will be somewhat disturbing to the pilot. The goal is to not have the autopilot introduce large oscillations not intended by the pilot.
This Will be implemented On a physical system that has sensors that provide an estimation of position, and the boundary shape is known and is unchanging. The actual system that I'm targeting is a quadcopter.

10252,Obstacle Avoidance while Navigating,"I need some ideas for strategies or algorithms to apply on these strategies to perform obstacle avoidance while navigating.
At the moment I'm doing offline path planning and obstacle avoidance of known obstacles with an occupancy grid. And running the A* algorithm over the created matrix. After that my robot follows along the resulting trajectory. This is done by splitting the whole trajectory into sub-path. The robot adjust it's heading to the new target and follows the straight line. The robot is controlled by a fuzzy logic controller to correct deviations from the ideal line (steering) and adjusting the velocity according to the steering action and distance to the target. So far so good. And it's working very well.
As sensor system, I solely use the Google Project Tango (Motion Tracking and Area Learning for proper path following). Now I want to use the depth perception capability of the device. Getting the appropriate depth information and extracting a possible obstacle is done with a quite simple strategy. The robot analyses the depth information in front of the robot and if any object is in between the robot and the target point of the sub-path, an obstacle must be there.
Now I'm wondering how to bypass this obstacle most efficiently. The robot is only aware of the height and width of the obstacle, but has no clue about the depth (only the front of the obstacle is scanned). Feeding the occupancy grid with this new obstacle and running again the A* algorithm is not effective, because of the missing depth. One possible strategy I could imagine is estimating a depth of the length of the grid cell, re-plan and continue the navigation. If the robot faces the same obstacle again, the depth is increased by the size of one additional grid cell length. But I think this is extremely ineffective. 
The requirement is to only use the Google Project Tango and no additional sensors, such as ultrasonic to sense the sides.
Update 1
The first picture illustrates the given trajectory from the path planning (orange). The gray and blue data points are the sensed obstacles in front of the robot. The notch behind the blue obstacle is actually the wall, but is shadowed by the blue obstacle. Image 2 shows the same scene just from a different perspective.
The issue I have to treat is, how to optimally bypass the blue obstacle even I don't know how deep it is. Driving to the left and to the right only to capture better data points (to generate a 3D model) is not possible. 


Update 2
Yes, I'm using a depth sensor, the one integrated in Google Project Tango. It's a visual measurement. A infra-red laser beams a grid onto the objects and a RGB-IR camera capture these information and evaluates the appropriate depth information.

10312,Difference between 3D Camera(using IR projection) and Stereo Camera?,"I am currently busy with a final year project which requires me to track people walking through a doorway.
I initially thought this may be possible using a normal camera and using some motion detection functions given in OpenCV, I have however come to the conclusion that the the camera is mounted too low for this to work effectively.(Height shown in the image below)

I have now been looking into using a 3D camera or a stereo camera to try and get around this problem.
I have seen similar examples where a Kinect(from Xbox 360) has been used to generate a depth map which is then processed and used to do the tracking, this was however done from a higher vantage point, and I found that the minimum operating range of the Kinect is 0.5m.
From what I have found, the Kinect uses an IR projector and receiver to generate its depth map, and have been looking at the Orbbec Astra S which uses a similar system and has a minimum working distance of 0.3m.
My question now:
What exactly would the difference be between the depth maps produced by a 3D camera that uses an IR projector and receiver, and a stereo camera such as the DUO/ZED type options?
I am just looking for some insight from people that may have used these types of cameras before
On a side note, am i going about this the right way? or should i be looking into Time of Flight Cameras instead? 
----EDIT----:
My goal is to count the people moving into and out of the train doorway. I began this using OpenCV, initially with a background subtraction and blob detection method. This only worked for one person at a time and with a test video filmed at a higher vantage point as a ""blob-merging"" problem was encountered as shown in the left image below.
So the next method tested involved an optical flow method using motion vectors obtained from OpenCV's dense optical flow algorithm.
From which i was able to obtain motion vectors from the higher test videos and track them as shown in the middle image below, because of the densely packed and easily detected motion vectors it was simple to cluster them.
But when this same system was attempted with footage taken from inside a train at a lower height, it was unable to give a consistant output. My thoughts of the reasons for this was because of the low height of the camera, single camera tracking is able to function when there is sufficient space between the camera and the top of the person. But as the distance is minimized, the area of the frame that the moving person takes up becomes larger and larger, and the space to which the person can be compared is reduced (or atleast that is how I understand it). Below on the right you can see how in the image the color of the persons clothing is almost uniform, Optical flow is therefore unable to detect it as motion in both cases.

I only started working with computer vision a few months ago so please forgive me if I have missed some crucial aspects.
From what i have seen from research, most commercial systems make used of a 3D cameras, stereo cameras or Time-of-Flight cameras, but I am unsure as to how the specifics of each of these would be best suited for my application.

10314,OpenRAVE output torques and simulation timestep,"I'm using OpenRAVE to simulate a quadruped, in order to get an idea of torque requirements. 
To get started I made a single DOF, single link pendulum to test controllers etc out on.
I've whipped up an inverse dynamics based PD controller using ComputeInverseDynamics(), which I set the outputs using SetDOFTorques(). I then set a desired position, with the desired velocity being zero. This all appears to work well and I can start the simulation, with the pendulum driving up to the desired position and settling. 
My concern is the value of the output torques. My pendulum is modeled as a simple box of length 1, mass manually set to 1, with a COM of 0.5.
When I run my simulation, I output the gravity component from ComputeInverseDynamics(). This gives 4.9NM, which matches up with hand calculated torques I expect from the pendulum (eg the static case) when it is driven to the desired position (from down to horizontal).
But the output torques to SetDOFTorques() are much higher and vary depending what I set the simulation timestep to.
If I maintain a controller update rate of 0.001 seconds, then for a simulation update of 0.0001 seconds, my output torque is approximately 87NM. If I alter the simulation timestep to 0.0005 seconds, keeping the controller rate the same the output torques drop down to about 18NM.
As an experiment I removed the inverse dynamics controller and replaced it with a plain PD controller, but I still see large output torques.
Can anyone shed some light on this? It's very possible I'm missing something here!
Thanks very much
Edits:
I'm adding the main section of my code. There is no trajectory generation, really. I'm just trying to get to a fixed static position.
In the code, if I keep dt fixed, and alter env.StartSimulation(timestep=0.0001), I get the issues popping up.

Here is some data for dt = 0.001 and env.StartSimulation(timestep=0.0001)
In this data,

taus is the torque command to the simulation, 
torquegravity+torquecoriolis is returned from the inverse dynamics 
a_cmd is the controller command and
M*a_cmd is the command after being multiplied by the mass matrix

The gravity and coriolis parts appear to be correct for steady state, where it should be about 4.9NM

Despite the differences in torque command (a_cmd) I still get similar performance, in that the arm drives to the right position fairly quickly.
As another experiment I set the initial position to pi/2 and just fed back the gravity term to the torque output. My understanding of this is that the arm should float, ala a gravity compensation sort of thing. But it just drops as if a small torque is applied.
Thanks again!

Good comments were made on this which leads me to clarify that I mean a pureposeful taking of life. I shy away from the term ""murder"" because that involves legal concepts, but I mean an intentional killing.
An interesting subdivision would be between robots under active human direction (""remote control"") and those with a degree of autonomy.

10325,Is horsepower related to torque in electric motors?,"Is torque related to size or power at all in electric motors? And what about gas motors too?
I have a go kart that is 2.5hp and it's 50cc and its about 1ft x 2ft x 1ft in size. I also see online there are .21 cubic inch gas motors for R/C cars that are also 2.5hp, the difference being that the R/C motor spins at 32k rpm while the go-kart motor spins at 12k rpm. If I were to put a gear reduction on the R/C motor, would it preform more or less the same as the go kart motor? Why is there a size difference?
Same for electric motors. I can buy an RC car electric motor that's 10hp and the size of a pop can. The CNC machine at work has a 10hp motor the size of a 5 gal bucket. Again, the only difference is the RPM.
If I were to reduce both setups so they spun at the same RPM, would they preform the same?
The only reasons I could think of is 1. Cooling and 2. RPM control (For PID loops and sensors)

The information I would know is the position of the person (the coordinates of the person in a JSON file) to be rescued from a building on fire. I would also know the rooms of the building from a map, but I don't know where the robot may be placed inside the building to start the rescue operation.
That means I have to localise the robot placed at an unknown position in a known environment, and then the robot can plan its path to the person who has to be rescued. But, since this is not my domain I would like you to guide me on what is the best method for localising given that I can use an IMU ( or gyro, accelerometer, magnetometer) and ultrasonic sensors to do the localising job. I cannot use a GPS module or a camera for this purpose. 
I, however, do know how to do path planning.
As far as my research on the Internet is concerned I have found a method called ""Kalman filtering"" that maybe can do the localising job. But there are I think some other filtering methods as well. Which one should I use? Or is there any other simpler/better method out there of which I don't know yet?
I am also attaching the map of the building which is known to me.

Edit:
The terrain is flat, and I would like to know where the robot is on the map like at coordinate 0,4 etc.

10334,Autonomous Navigation without Distance Sensors,"I'm doing a project with the iRobot Create 2. I want it to be able to map out a room and navigate to a point for example. My problem is that the robot doesn't have any distance sensors. What it can do is detect if there is an obstacle ahead of it or not (0 or 1) and it can measure how far it has traveled in millimeters. Any good techniques out there or best to buy an IR sensor?

10348,quaternion implementation,"I am trying to implement quaternions and i am using CC2650 sensortag board from TI. This board has MPU9250 from invensense which has Digital Motion Processor (DMP) in it. This DMP gives quaternion, but for my understanding i implemented my own quaternion. I used Gyroscope and acceleorometer values coming out of DMP (which are calibrated ) to calculate angle of rotation. I feed this angle, in 3 directions (x,y,z), to my quaternion. I am not able to match my quaternion values with DMP quaternion values. In fact it's way off, so wondering what I have done wrong.
Following are detailed steps that i did :
1)  Tapped Gyro sensor values from function read_from_mpl.
2)  Converted gyro values in to float by diving by 2^16. As gyro values are in Q16 format.
3)  Now used Gyro values of 3 axis and found out resultant using formula : 
Gr = sqrt(Gx^2+Gy^2+Gz^2)
Where Gx,Gy and Gz are Gyro values along x-axis,y-axis and z-axis respectively.
4)  Now Angle is derived using above found resultant Gr by : 
*Angle = Gr*1/sample_rate*
       Where sample_rate is found using API call ,mpu_get_sample_rate(&sample_rate)
5)  This Angle is fed to angle_to_quater function which basically converts angle to axis and then quaternion multiplication.

6)  I also added  doing angle calculations from accelerometer as follows : Here also accelerometer is converted to float by dividing by 2^16, as acceleorometer values also in Q16 format.
*//acc_data[0]->Ax, acc_data[1]->Ay, acc_data[2]->Az
temp = (acc_data[0]*acc_data[0]) + (acc_data[1]*acc_data[1]);
acc_angle[0]=atan2(acc_data[2],temp)*RAD_TO_DEG;
temp = (acc_data[1]*acc_data[1]) + (acc_data[2]*acc_data[2]);
acc_angle[1]=atan2(acc_data[0],temp)*RAD_TO_DEG;
temp = (acc_data[1]*acc_data[1]) + (acc_data[0]*acc_data[0]);
acc_angle[2]=atan2(acc_data[1],temp)*RAD_TO_DEG;*

*Find resultant angle of this also as :
inst_acc_angle = (sqrt(acc_angle[0]*acc_angle[0] + acc_angle[1]*acc_angle[1] + acc_angle[2]*acc_angle[2]));*

7)  Then complimentary filter is :
*FinalAngle = 0.96*Angle + 0.04*inst_acc_angle;
This Final Angle is fed to step 5 to get quaternion.*
Quaternion multiplication is done as below and then normailized to get new quaternion (q). 
quater_mul :
q3.w = -q1.x * q2.x - q1.y * q2.y - q1.z * q2.z + q1.w * q2.w;
q3.x =  q1.x * q2.w + q1.y * q2.z - q1.z * q2.y + q1.w * q2.x;
q3.y = -q1.x * q2.z + q1.y * q2.w + q1.z * q2.x + q1.w * q2.y;
q3.z =  q1.x * q2.y - q1.y * q2.x + q1.z * q2.w + q1.w * q2.z;

quat_normalize:
double mag = pow(q->w,2) + pow(q->x,2) + pow(q->y,2) + pow(q->z,2);
mag = sqrt(mag);
q->w = q->w/mag;
q->x = q->x/mag;
q->y = q->y/mag;
q->z = q->z/mag;

When i check my quaternion values with DMP, they are WAY off. Can you please provide some insights in to what could be wrong here.

My robot is equipped with the hokuyo urg-04lx-ug01. 
I have odometry hence passing it to the updater: 

As I start moving the robot starts discovering room A and then room B & C already the map seems to have rotated. I come back to room A and return the initial pose end=start using the same path. Now I noticed room A has significantly rotated in relation to the other room. Consequently the map isn't correct at all, neither is the path travelled by the robot. 

Wasn't the SLAM supposed to store and keep the boundaries for the first room it discovered?
Why this rotation may be happening?
How could I try to troubleshoot this issue with the data I have collected (odometry, calculated position, liDAR scans)?
Can I tune SLAM to do a better job for my robot?

SLAM is pretty new to me, so please bear with me, any pointers on literature that may clarify and moderate my expectations of what SLAM can do.

Odometry observation equations
If you would wonder how I come to the observation equations for the odometry data: 

$\ V_{vl} = V{c} + \dot \theta \cdot b \rightarrow V_{vl} = \sqrt{ \dot x^{2} + \dot y^{2}} + \dot \theta \cdot b$
Problem
If I try the small-size EKF, using a Matlab user interface, it does seem to drive a straight line, but not under a heading of 0 like I would expect. Eventhough I start with a state vector of $\ x= \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}$ meaning starting at position [0,0] in the global coordinate frame, with speed and acceleration of zero and under an angle of 0.

In the top right corner you can see the measurement data which I give as input, which is 5 wheelspeed counts on every wheel, every sampling period. (Simulating straight driving vehicle)
In the top left corner you see a plot of the X and Y coordinate (from state vector) at the end of one predict+update cycle of the filter, labeled with the timecycle.
Bottom left corner is a plot of the angle in the state vector. You see that after 12 cycles the angle is still almost 0 like I would expect.
Could anyone please provide some insights in to what could be wrong here? 
Solutions I've been thinking on

I could use the 'odometry motion model' like explained in this question. The difference is that the odometry data is inserted in the predict step of the filter. But if I would do this, I see 2 problems: 1) I don't see how to make a small-size version of this for testing purposes, because I don't know which measurements to add in the update-step and 2) for the medium-size version I don't know how to make the observation equations as the state vector doesn't imply velocity and acceleration.
I could use the 'odometry motion model' and in the update step use the Euler-angle, which can be linked to $\ \theta $. This Euler-angle I can obtain from the Digital Motion Processor (DMP), implemented in the IMU. Then it is no problem that angular velocity is not in the state matrix. But than I still have a problem with the acceleration observation equations.

10404,Addressing the sample impoverishment in particle filter,"I have implemented a particle filter algorithm for the state estimation of a mobile robot.
There are several external range sensors(transmitters) in the environment which gives information on the distance (radius) of the robot based on the time taken for the receiver on the robot to send back its acknowledgement. So, using three or more such transmitters it will be possible to triangulate the position of the robot.
The particle filter is initialized with 15000 particles and the sensor noise is relatively low (0.02m).
Update Phase: At each iteration a range information from an external sensor is received. This assigns higher weights to the particles along the radius of the external sensor. Not all the particles are equally weighted since the process noise is low. Hence in most of the cases, the particle relatively closer to the robot gets lower weight than an incorrect one that happens to be along the radius. The weight is a pdf.
Resampling Phase: At this stage, the lower weighted particle(the correct one) that has negligible weight gets lost because the higher weighted particle gets picked up.
All this happens at the first iteration and so when the range information from another sensor arrives, the robot is already kidnapped.
Googling around, said that this problem is called as sample impoverishment and the most common approach is to resample only when the particle variance is low. (Effective Sample Size < number of particles / 2)
But, when the particles are assigned negligible weights and there are relatively very few particles with higher weights, the diversity of the particles are lost at resampling phase. So, when the variance is higher resampling is done which removes the lower weighted particle and hence the diversity of the particles is lost. Isnt this completely the opposite of the above idea of ESS?
Is my understanding of sample impoverishment correct? Is there a way this issue can be fixed?
Any pointers or help would be highly appreciated.

10408,Localization of a Robot to find it Coordinates according to the Known Map,"I am a third-year electrical engineering student and am working on an intelligent autonomous robot in my summer vacations.
The robot I am trying to make is supposed to be used in rescue operations. The information I would know is the position of the person (the coordinates of the person in a JSON file that can be changed anytime except during the challenge) to be rescued from a building on fire. I would also know the rooms of the building from a map, but I don't know where the robot may be placed inside the building to start the rescue operation.
That means I have to localise the robot placed at an unknown position in a known environment, and then the robot can plan its path to the person who has to be rescued. I can use gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer and ultrasonic sensors to do the localising job. I cannot use a GPS module or a camera for this purpose.
The object to be rescued (whose location is known in terms of coordinates & can be changed anytime) is surrounded by walls from 3 sides. Hence, adding more walls in this map.
According to my research particle filter is the best method used for localization of robot. But how can I deal with the landmarks (walls) that are fixed as shown in the map image and that are variable depending on the location of the object to be rescued being provided in the JSON file?
I can do the path planning from a known position to the target position, but I'm not sure how to determine the starting position.
More about JSON file:
(1) json file containing the coordinates of the object to be rescued can change. (2) it won't change during the challenge. (3) json file will be provided to me in an SD card that my robot has to read. I have successfully written the code that will allow the robot to read the json file and hence the coordinates of the object to be rescued.
Here is the map of the building which is known to me.

10415,Determining the graspable range of a robot arm,"I have a 6 DOF robot arm, and I want to do some object grasping experiments. Here, the robot is rigidly mounted to a table, and the object is placed on a different adjacent table. The robot must pick up the object with its gripper parallel to the normal of the object's table, such that it is pointing directly downwards at the point of grasping.
Now, the two tables have adjustable heights. For any given height difference between them. there will be a fixed range of positions over which the robot arm can achieve this perpendicular pose. What I am trying to figure out, is what the optimum relative distance of the tables is such that this range of positions is maximum.
Is there a way to compute this analytically given the robot arm kinematics? Or is there a solution which applies to all robot arms (e.g. it is optimum when the tables are at the same height)?
If it is important, the arm is the Kinova MICO: .

10427,Is there a portable and accurate sensor to measure the position of the hand relative to the body?,"My team has been working on a wearable glove to capture data about hand movements, and use it as a human-computer interface for a variety of applications. One of the major applications is the translation of sign language, shown here: 
Right now we can only translate letters and numbers, because the signs for them require the person to hold their hand still in one position ('stationary' signs). I want to be able to translate words as well, which are non-stationary signs. Also the position of the hands really matters when signing words, for example it matters whether the hand is in front of the forehead, eyes, mouth, chest, cheeks, etc.
For this we need a portable and highly accurate position sensor. We have tried getting position from a 9-DOF IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) but as you might guess, there were many problems with double integration of the noise and accelerometer bias.
So is there a device that can provide accurate position information? It should be portable and wearable (for example worn in the chest pocket, headband/cap, etc...be creative!).
EDIT (more details):
I'm going to emphasize certain aspects of this design that weren't clear before, based on people's comments:

My current problem of position detection is due to errors in double integration of the accelerometer data. So hopefully the solution has some incredibly powerful kalman filter (I think this is unlikely) or  uses some other portable device instead of an accelerometer.
I do not need absolute position of the hand in space/on earth. I only need the hand position relative to some stable point on the body, such as the chest or belly. So maybe there can be a device on the hand that can measure position relative to a wearable device on the body. I don't know if such technology exists; I guess it'd use either magnets, ultrasound, bend sensors, or EM waves of some sort. Be creative :)

In my opinion, Mapping in SLAM is the same term as 3D Reconstruction, while Localization is the essential part for Mapping. So I don't find a difference between SLAM and 3D Reconstruction, am I wrong (or is the author misclassfying)?

Edit
What it tries to learn is this, it has 16 inputs which contains the line positions for the last 15 iterations and this iteration. Line position is between -1 and 1 which -1 means only left most sensor sees the line and 0 means the line is in the center. I want it to learn a line position that when it faces this input again it will set that line position like its the center and take the curve according to that line position. For example error is required position - line position so let say i had 16 0 as input then i calculated the required as 0.4. So after that the car will center itself at 0.4 i hope this helps :)

I have been studying whatever I can get regarding the measurement the state (relative position, relative velocity, relative heading and roation, a.k.a. yaw rate) of surrounding objects especially other vehicles using sensors.
While everything else is possible to measure precisely using on-board sensors, I have found out that not much literature is available for measuring the vehicle heading and yaw rate of other vehicles which is baffling to me given the extreme precision of laser based sensing (albeit using time stamps).
I am looking for:

Reference to literature with experiments for estimation of yaw rate and vehicle heading.
As I can see from the literature available (or the lack thereof), no direct way of measuring yaw rate is available but by using LIDAR or Camera with consecutive time stamps or scans of data. However, this inherently requires the data to be correct. Hence, I would think that due to the inaccuracies involved, this method is not used! Is this correct?
Are there any commercially available sensors that give accurate heading and yaw rate information of other vehicles?

Sources and research papers would be most welcome!
Edit: By this inherently requires the data to be correct I mean, given the high sensitivity to error in heading or yaw rate at high vehicle speeds, the values computed using sensor information is not accurate enough to be put to use in practice!

10484,Equations of motion of 3D pendulum-like system,"I'm trying to get the equations of motion of a 3D pendulum system (spherical pendulum), however I don't want to describe the system using spherical coordinates (which there is lot of information about). 
Instead I want to describe the system using x,y,z coordinates of the mass as well as the euler angles phi, theta, psi (the roll, pitch and yaw of the mass). 
That is, I want to assume that the mass has a position and an orientation in relation to the inertial frame. 
Furthermore this is a 3D pendulum system, where the mass, which is symmetric, is actuated (notice that this is a simplification of the system needed to actuate the mass, where only the resulting forces and torques are taken into account):

There is a force F acting in the x-axis direction of the mass reference frame
There is a torque T acting about the z-axis of the mass reference frame
There is also the gravitational force acting on the center of mass (in the negative direction of z-axis of the inertial reference frame

In order to clear misconceptions about how this forces are generated, think of the mass as a differential drive robot using fans instead of wheels.
The cable connecting the mass to the anchor point is assumed rigid and works as a distance constraint modeled by:
$\|r_{anchor} - r_{mass}\| = cable\_length$
Where $r_{anchor}$ is the position of the anchor point to which the mass is connected through the cable and $r_{mass}$ is the position of the mass. This constraint makes it so that it is similar to having two spherical joints: one at the anchor point and another at the mass. Futhermore the cable is assumed to have no mass. 
It's important to note that this rigid connection (calbe) is meant to be modeled by the distant constraint refered above.

I'm looking for help solving this system to obtain its equations of motion.

I have several questions:

Is there a better way to calibrate magnetometer? Is the calibration sufficient, without using the Madgwick or Kalman filter?
Is there some nonlinearity present in the sensor? Since the yaw offset isn't constant, it changes (around -12 degrees up north to almost correct value at southwest). And if it is, how could I measure that nonlinearity and apply to the yaw measurements?
If I have to use Madgwick or Kalman, do I have to apply them on quaternions? I believe that applying them at the final yaw measurements wouldn't do the job.

My question is, based on the scatter plot that the LIDAR is returning, how can we retrieve the position of my robot in the map ? We would need the , y position in the map frame and also the theta angle from the map frame to my robot frame.
We have tried to match objects on map with groups of points based on their distance between each other and by identifying those objects and the way the LIDAR ""sees"" them to retrieve the robot position. But it is still unsuccessful.

10556,Quadrature encoder signal from dc motor is very noisy,"I'm starting out with robotics, got my first DC gear motor with quadrature encoder ():

I ultimately plan to hook it up to a motor driver connected to a Tiva Launchpad. However, since I'm a noob, and curious, I am starting by just playing with it with my breadboard, oscilloscope, and voltage source. E.g., when I plug in the motor power lines into my (variable) voltage source the axis spins nicely as expected between 1 and 12 V.
The problems start when I try to check how the encoder works. To do this, first I plug a a 5V source into the encoder GND/Vcc, and then try to monitor the encoder output.
While the motor is running, I check the Yellow (encoder A output) cable (referencing it to the green (encoder GND) cable).  I made a video that shows a representative output from one of the lines (no USB on my old oscilloscope so I took a video of it using my phone).
As you would see at the video, the output doesn't look anything like the beautiful square waves you typically see in the documentation. Instead, it is an extremely degraded noisy sin wave (at the correct frequency for the encoder). The amplitude of the sin is not constant, but changes drastically over time. Strangely, sometimes it ""locks in"" and looks like the ideal square wave, for about a second or two, but then it gets all wonky again.
Both of the lines (encoder A and B output) act this way, and they act this way at the same time (e.g., they will both lock in and square up at the same time, for those brief glorious moments of clarity). Both of my motors are the same, so I don't think it's that I have a bad motor.
I have also checked using Vcc=12V, but it made no difference other than changing the amplitude of the output.

10573,Technique to increase POV resolution,"I have thought of a technique to increase the resolution of a POV (persistence of vision) display. In an usual POV display, the LEDs are arranged in a strip and spun in a circle. There are two limiting factors to increasing the radial resolution along the circumference of any one circular path that an LED follows. One is, depending on the speed of the POV wheel, the minimum time required (decided by the microcontroller) to change the LED's color in case of a RGB. The other factor is the LED's width, that increases the 'bleeding' of color from one pixel to the neighboring pixel if the LED changes color or brightness too fast. 
If one were to fix a slit in the front of an LED, |*|  <-- like so, would this help improve the resolution of the POV display; by doing this one would in effect be reducing the width of the 'pixel' along the circumference on which the led would be traversing.
Thus if one were to use a fast enough microcontroller and a narrow enough slit, one could probably obtain a very high resolution along one dimension at least.
